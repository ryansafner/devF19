  - Being an "oathbreaker" deigns one as a social outcast (and is a virtual death sentence without protection from sovereign lords)

# The Economics of Sharecropping I

.pull-left[

- Consider two individuals: 

1. Farmer
2. Landowner

- Farmer and Landowner must write a contract to agree on how to divide the surplus

# The Economics of Sharecropping III

.pull-left[

- One extreme solution:

- Farmer pays a fixed fee up front, once paid, the farmer keeps all surplus

- Would have to be high enough to be worthwhile to the landlord

- Problems with this solution:
  1. requires high upfront cost to farmer (often poor, capital-constrained)
  2. imposes the entirety of the risk on the farmer (bad harvest, weather, invasion, theft)

# The Economics of Sharecropping III

.pull-left[

- A risk-sharing agreement: worker pays a smaller (or no) upfront fee, and surplus output is shared between parties somehow
  - for sake of argument, suppose surplus is split 50-50

- Risk of a bad harvest is shared by the farmer and the landowner

- New **principle-agent problems** introduced:
  1. Farmer has an incentive to *underreport* to landlord how much surplus they produce, effectively "stealing" more than their share
    - landowner must monitor farmer to reduce this possibility (and this is costly)
  2. Farmer is effectively taxed (50%, in this example) on their output
    - has 50% less incentive to be productive than if they were 100% residual claimant
    - farmer will exert less effort since they get less of the output

Nor will I ever with will or action, through word or deed, do anything which is unpleasing to him, on condition that he will hold to me as I shall deserve it, and that he will perform everything as it was in our agreement when I submitted myself to him and chose his will." - 7th Century Anglo-Saxon "Oath of Fealty"

&gt; A good part of the **politics of measurement** sprang from what a contemporary economist might call **the "stickiness" of feudal rents.** Noble and clerical claimants often found it **difficult to increase feudal dues directly**; the levels set for various charges were the **result of long struggle,** and even a small increase above the customary level was viewed as a **threatening breach of tradition.** Adjusting the measure, however, represented a roundabout way of achieving the same end.

&gt; The local lord might, for example, lend grain to peasants in smaller baskets and insist on repayment in larger baskets. He might surreptitiously or even boldly enlarge the size of the grain sacks accepted for milling (a monopoly of the domain lord) and reduce the size of the sacks used for measuring out flour; he might also collect feudal dues in larger baskets and pay wages in kind in smaller baskets. While the formal custom governing feudal dues and wages would thus remain intact (requiring, for example, the same number of sacks of wheat from the harvest of a given holding), the actual transaction might increasingly favor the lord. The results of such fiddling were far from trivial. Kula estimates that the size of the bushel (boisseau) used to collect the main feudal rent (taille) increased by one-third between 1674 and 1716 as part of what was called the reaction feodale.

&gt; "**[T]he medieval way of determining the terms of exchange was by custom, usage, and law, not by negotiation between traders.** The division of labor was well developed by the Middle Ages, and there was a corollary exchange of products and services among specialized workers. But the **use of custom and law to set the terms of trade was as fundamental to the medieval economy as the unity of its political and economic institutions**," (p.38).

&gt; "We argue that the effect of economic change on political power is a key factor in determining whether technological advances and beneficial economic changes will be blocked. In other words, we propose a "political-loser hypothesis." We argue that it is groups whose political power (not economic rents) is eroded who will block technological advances. If agents are economic losers but have no political power, they cannot impede technological progress. If they have and maintain political power (i.e., are not political losers), then they have no incentive to block progress. It is therefore agents who have political power and fear losing it who will have incentives to block. Our analysis suggests that we should look more to the nature of political institutions and the determinants of the distribution of political power if we want to understand technological backwardness," (pp.126-127).

# Power and Personality

.pull-left[

- Elites are loyal to the king as a *person*, not as an office!

- Loyalty depends on king's ability to distribute booty and rents to elites

- "King" or "Warlord" does not control *territory*, controls *vassals* based on social networks and bundle of privileges

# Monarch's Role as Head of Patronage Networks I

.pull-left[
- Monarch is head of many patronage networks, often from the most powerful/wealthiest family 

- Has siblings and many blood relations that expect patronage or else they might challenge claim to throne

- Monarch must redistribute as patronage (land, titles, marriages, inheritances) to loyal supporters to maintain support

# Monarch's Role as Head of Patronage Networks II

.pull-left[
- After 1066 conquest, William I the Conquerer claims *all* land in England

- Nobody owns land in their own right, all land is property of the King
  - Of course, King cannot govern entirety of land all the time
  - Nobles retain control over their domains, but nominally owned by King
  
- Monarchs often reclaim ("escheat") land from nobles who *break* fealty, commit treason, or die without heirs
  - redistribute to loyal elites as patronage
  - inheritance must be "bought" with "relief" (a fee) to the King
