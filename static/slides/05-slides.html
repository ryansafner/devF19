- Why isn't the whole world equally productive?

- Different countries have different resources (factors of production)
    - Land, labor, capital, education, technology, etc.

&gt; "After all the fertile land in the immediate neighbourhood of the first settlers were cultivated, if capital and population increased, more food would be required, and it could only be procured from land not so advantageously situated. Supposing then the land to be equally fertile, the necessity of employing more labourers, horses, &amp;c. to carry the produce from the place where it was grown, to the place where it was to be consumed, although no alteration were to take place in the wages of labour, would make it necessary that more capital should be permanently employed to obtain the same produce." (Book IV, Chapter 9)

&gt; "Thus by bringing successively land of a worse quality, or less favourably situated into cultivation, rent would rise on the land previously cultivated, and precisely in the same degree would profits fall; and if the smallness of profits do not check accumulation, there are hardly any limits to the rise of rent, and the fall of profit,"

# An Aggregate Production Function: Implications

Under constant returns:

- If two countries have the same technology, there is no economic advantage to size

- Labor productivity `\(\left(\frac{Y}{L}\right)\)`, output-per-worker/hour, is determined only by `\(\left(\frac{K}{L}\right)\)`, capital-per-worker/hour

`$$Y = MP_LL + MP_KK + MP_T T$$`

- With competitive markets, firms pay each factor its marginal product, firms earn no profits&lt;sup&gt;.red[1]&lt;/sup&gt;

.footnote[&lt;sup&gt;.red[1]&lt;/sup&gt; This is also called the "product exhaustion theorem," and comes from [Euler's Theorem for homogeneous functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_function#Positive_homogeneity) (constant returns functions are homogeneous of degree 1).]

# An Aggregate Production Function: Cobb-Douglas I

.pull-left[

- A very common functional form in economics is .shout[Cobb-Douglas]

`$$Y=AK^{\alpha}L^{1-\alpha}$$`

- Exponents `\((\alpha)\)` and `\((1-\alpha)\)` are "output-elasticities"
    - A 1% increase in K (L) will yield a `\(\alpha\)`% `\((1-\alpha)%\)` increase in Y

- Constant returns to scale&lt;sup&gt;.red[1]&lt;/sup&gt;: a k% increase in *all* factors of production will yield a k% increase in `\(Y\)`

# The "Simple" Solow Model and Kaldor's Facts

1. In steady state, `\(g_y=0\)` and `\(g_k=0\)`: output and capital (per worker) do now grow!

2. The only explanation that fits with Kaldor's facts (1-2) is that all countries must be BELOW their steady states

3. Growth would have to be slowing down over time

- These are motivations for the "full Solow" model

- **Technology** grows at constant rate `\(g\)` over time

- Redefine `\(k \equiv \frac{K_t}{A_tL_t}\)` as capital per *effective* worker
  - Labor is being augmented by technology, hence `\(A_t \times L_t\)`

# The "Full" Solow Model II

1. `\(\Delta k = sf(k_t)-(\delta+n+g)k_t\)`
  - Capital per effective worker is equal to investment (first term) minus **break-even investment**

2. Break even investment: `\((\delta+n+g)k\)`
  - Amount of investment necessary to keep `\(k\)` constant, consists of:
      - `\(\delta k\)`: to replace capital depreciation
      - `\(nk\)`: to provide capital to new workers

Solow's findings for 1909-1949 in the United States:

1. Output per worker grew by about 100%
2. Capital-to-labor ratio grew by about 30% ("capital-deepening")
3. Technology grew by about 87.5%
    - i.e. 87.5% of the growth in output per worker came from Technology; 12.5% from increases in capital per worker

# Macro Models In the 30 Years Since Solow (1956)

- **Ramsey-Kass-Koopmans model** (1965): Solow model with .onfire[microfoundations]!
  - Savings rate `\(s\)` is endogenized: 
  - "infinitely-lived" utility-maximizing individuals decide to supply labor and rent capital to cost-minimizing firms in order to earn income, which they can consume and save for future periods
  - single steady state equilibrium
  - groundwork for all modern macro dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models

--

- **Overlapping Generations (Diamond) model** (1965):
  - Individuals live for 2 periods only (work and retire), determine the savings rate
  - Multiple steady state equilibria possible
  - Economy subject to dynamic inefficiency

---

# The Motivations for Romer

- Problems with how Solow models the aggregate economy:

1. "Knowledge" (TFP) has a non-rival component to it

2. Markets/aggregate production function cannot possibly be competitive and constant returns to scale
    - Market power/monopolistic competition
    - Increasing returns to scale

3. Knowledge does not grow exogenously, but is the result of market forces and optimizing choices: people and firms face incentives to create and exploit it (or not)

# Romer Model Implication I - R&amp;D Is Critical

- Economies tend to undersupply human capital to research:

&gt; The most obvious reason is that research has positive external effects. An additional design raises the productivity of all future individuals who do research, but because this benefit is nonexcludable, it is not reflected at all in the market price for designs. The second and an equally important reason...is that research produces an input that is purchased by a sector that engages in monopoly pricing. The markup of price over marginal cost forces a wedge between the marginal social product of an input used in this sector and its market compensation," (p.S96)

--

- Policy implications:

&gt; "Within the confines of the model, the social optimum can be achieved by subsidizing the accumulation of A," (p.S97)

&gt; "A subsidy to physical capital accumulation may be a very poor substitute for direct subsidies that increase the incentive to undertake research. In the absence of feasible policies that can remove the divergence between the social and private returns to research, a second-best policy would be to subsidize the accumulation of total human capital," (p.S99)

---

# Romer Model Implication II - Trade Liberalization

- A large population is *not* sufficient for greater technology (and thus, economic growth), it requires access to a *larger market* (division of labor)!

&gt; If access to a large number of workers or consumers were all that mattered, having a large population would be a good substitute for trade with other nations. The model here suggests that what is important for growth is integration not into an economy with a large number of people but rather into one with a large amount of human capital, (p.S98)

&gt; "The most interesting positive implication of the model is that an economy with a larger total stock of human capital will experience faster growth. This finding suggests that free international trade can act to speed up growth. It also suggests a way to understand what it is about developed economies in the twentieth century that permitted rates of growth of income per capita that are unprecedented in human history. The model also suggests that low levels of human capital may help explain why growth is not observed in underdeveloped economies that are closed and why a less developed economy with a very large population can still benefit from economic integration with the rest of the world," (p.S99)

    - Even clearer: counties that *gained* access to new waterway (i.e. a new canal) saw sharp increase in patenting!

# Takeaways from Growth Models

.pull-left[

1. HICs have more output per worker and capital per worker than LICs
2. The accumulation of physical capital itself explains a very small part of differences in income
3. "Knowledge" or "TFP" explains the overhelming part of growth differences across the world
4. Solow model predicts LICs should grow at faster rates than HICs
5. The evidence for (4) is mixed and controversial

6. Growth literature suggests economies can grow faster by subsidizing the accumulation of capital, or human capital, or "knowledge"
    - The evidence that we are able to do this, or have been able to, is *quite poor*

7. An economy's "TFP" is more sensitive to its institutions and incentives than simply amassing `\(K\)` or `\(H\)` or `\(A\)`

# Growth Models: An Appraisal

.pull-left[
- For all of their flaws, growth models are part of the "shared" language of development experts, policy makers, and macroeconomists

- Explain (some) mechanisms of growth that we can model and predict (some) consequence of (some) policy changes

- Give us a measure of how much we *can* explain based on what we understand, and how much we *cannot* explain and *need* to understand

&gt; All models are wrong. Some are useful. - George Box
