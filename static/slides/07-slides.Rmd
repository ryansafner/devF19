> "The conversation remained friendly, even though the tension between the two societies that Yali and I represented was familiar to both of us. Two centuries ago, all New Guineans were still "living in the Stone Age." That is, they still used stone tools similar to those superseded in Europe by metal tools thousands of years ago, and they dwelt in villages not organized under any centralized political authority. Whites had arrived, imposed centralized government, and brought material goods whose value New Guineans instantly recognized, ranging from steel axes, matches, and medicines to clothing, soft drinks, and umbrellas. In New Guinea all these goods were referred to collectively as "cargo."

> "In order to reduce the effect of post-1500 population movements, the Olsson– Hibbs sample excludes the neo-European countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States), as well as countries whose current income is based primarily on extractive wealth. Column 2 replicates the estimates of column 1 using this restricted sample—the joint explanatory power of geographic variables rises to 55 percent, since the new sample excludes regions that are rich today as a result of the guns, germs, and steel of colonizing Europeans rather than purely geographic factors," (p.5).

> These empirical results provide **strong evidence in favor of Diamond’s hypotheses,** while suggesting that **the geographic component of the story is empirically more relevant than the biological component.** Column 6 goes further in the attempt to control for the effect of post-1500 population movements, by restricting the sample to the Old World (defined as all countries minus the Americas and Oceania). The effect of geography now rises to 64 percent—again highly **consistent with Diamond’s idea that biogeographic conditions matter mostly in the Old World**," (p.5).

# Geography and Economic Development V

> While geographic factors may have continued to affect economic development after the introduction of agriculture, the availability of prehistoric domesticable wild plant and animal species did not influence population density in the past two millennia other than through the timing of the Neolithic transition...The results of column 3 (OLS) and column 4 (IV) of table 2 illustrate their findings: **years since the agricultural transition has a strong, statistically significant positive effect on population density in 1500**...The magnitude of the effect is large, as a one standard deviation change in years of agriculture is associated with 63 percent of a standard deviation change in log population density in 1500 (OLS)..All of the other regressors feature much smaller standardized effects.

> They show, not only that **an earlier onset of the Neolithic transition contributed to the level of technological sophistication in the preindustrial world**, but also that **the effect of Diamond’s biogeographic factors may well operate through the legacy of an early exposure to agriculture**," (pp.7-8).

# Population Density

- Population density is a good proxy for economic development

- Better than wages or real incomes

- Malthusian dynamics of a pre-modern economy
    - More prosperous regions have high population, which lowers real wages

- Population is also easier to measure and get data for than real wages!

# Mitigating Disease has BIG Payoffs

> "This study estimates long-run impacts of a child health investment, exploiting  community-wide experimental  variation inschool-based deworming. The program increased labor supply among men and education among women, with accompanying shifts in labor market specialization. Ten years afterde-worming treatment, men who were eligible as boys stay enrolled for more yearsof primary school, work 17% more hours each week, spend more time in non-agricultural self-employment, are more likely to hold manufacturing jobs, and miss one fewer meal per week. Women who were in treatment schools as girlsare approximately one quarter more likely to have attended secondary school, halving the gender gap. They reallocate time from traditional agriculture intocash crops and  nonagricultural self-employment. We  estimate a conservativeannualized financial internal rate of return to  deworming of 32%, and show that mass deworming may generate more in future government revenue than it costs in subsidies.

# Geography and Development: Insects III

> "The TseTse fly is unique to Africa and transmits a parasite harmful to humans and lethal to livestock. This paper tests the hypothesis that the TseTse reduced the ability of Africans to generate an agricultural surplus historically. Ethnic groups inhabiting TseTse-suitable areas were less likely to use domesticated animals and the plow, less likely to be politically centralized, and had a lower population density. These correlations are not found in the tropics outside of Africa, where the fly does not exist. The evidence suggests current economic performance is affected by the TseTse through the channel of precolonial political centralization," (p. 382).

> "[A] one standard deviation increase in the TSI is associated with a 23 percentage point decrease in the likelihood an African ethnic group had large domesticated animals, a 9 percentage point decrease in intensive cultivation, and a 6 percentage point reduc- tion in plow use. A one standard deviation increase in the TSI is correlated with a significant reduction in historical population density. Motivated by the land abun- dance literature, two institutions are explored in this paper: political centralization and indigenous slavery. A one standard deviation increase in the TSI is associated with a 10 percentage point increase in the likelihood that an ethnic group used slaves and an 8 percentage point decrease in the probability it was centralized," (p.384).

Since there is a diversity of views regarding the second of these statements (what exactly drives growth), we have a similar diversity of views on the natural resource question," (p.833).

For example, the Mughals in India and the Aztecs and Incas in the Americas were among the richest civilizations in 1500, while the civilizations in North America, New Zealand, and Australia were less developed. Today the United States, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia are an order of magnitude richer than the countries now occupying the terri- tories of the Mughal, Aztec, and Inca Empires," (p.1231).

> "Figure I shows a negative relationship between the percent of the population living in towns with more than 5000 inhabitants in 1500 and income per capita today. Figure II shows the same negative relationship between log population density (number of inhabitants per square kilometer) in 1500 and income per capita today," (p.1232).

# AJR: These Hypotheses Fail to Explain the Reversal

> "The reversal in relative incomes weighs against [the] simple version of the geography hypothesis," (p.1233).

> "Although plausible, the temperate drift hypothesis cannot account for the reversal. First, the reversal in relative incomes seems to be related to population density and prosperity before Europeans arrived, not to any inherent geographic characteristics of the area. Furthermore, according to the temperate drift hypothesis, the reversal should have occurred when European agricultural technology spread to the colonies. Yet, while the introduction of European agricultural techniques, at least in North America, took place earlier, the reversal occurred during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and is closely related to industrialization. Another version of the sophisticated geography hypothesis could be that certain geographic characteristics, such as the presence of coal reserves or easy access to the sea, facilitated industrialization...But we do not find any evidence that these geographic factors caused industrialization. Our reading of the evidence therefore provides little support to various sophisticated geography hypotheses either," (p.1233-1234).

# AJR: It's Institutions!

> "An alternative view, which we believe provides the best explanation for the patterns we document, is the "institutions hypothesis," relating differences in economic performance to the organization of society. Societies that provide incentives and opportunities for investment will be richer than those that fail to do so... As we discuss in more detail below, we hypothesize that a cluster of institutions ensuring secure property rights for a broad cross section of society, which we refer to as institutions of private property, are essential for investment incentives and successful economic performance. In contrast, extractive institutions, which concentrate power in the hands of a small elite and create a high risk of expropriation for the majority of the population, are likely to discourage investment and economic development. Extractive institutions, despite their adverse effects on aggregate performance, may emerge as equilibrium institutions because they increase the rents captured by the groups that hold political power." (p.1234-5).

- Much more on this later!
