> "The conversation remained friendly, even though the tension between the two societies that Yali and I represented was familiar to both of us. Two centuries ago, all New Guineans were still "living in the Stone Age." That is, they still used stone tools similar to those superseded in Europe by metal tools thousands of years ago, and they dwelt in villages not organized under any centralized political authority. Whites had arrived, imposed centralized government, and brought material goods whose value New Guineans instantly recognized, ranging from steel axes, matches, and medicines to clothing, soft drinks, and umbrellas. In New Guinea all these goods were referred to collectively as "cargo."

> "In order to reduce the effect of post-1500 population movements, the Olsson– Hibbs sample excludes the neo-European countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States), as well as countries whose current income is based primarily on extractive wealth. Column 2 replicates the estimates of column 1 using this restricted sample—the joint explanatory power of geographic variables rises to 55 percent, since the new sample excludes regions that are rich today as a result of the guns, germs, and steel of colonizing Europeans rather than purely geographic factors," (p.5).

> These empirical results provide **strong evidence in favor of Diamond’s hypotheses,** while suggesting that **the geographic component of the story is empirically more relevant than the biological component.** Column 6 goes further in the attempt to control for the effect of post-1500 population movements, by restricting the sample to the Old World (defined as all countries minus the Americas and Oceania). The effect of geography now rises to 64 percent—again highly **consistent with Diamond’s idea that biogeographic conditions matter mostly in the Old World**," (p.5).

# Geography and Economic Development V

> While geographic factors may have continued to affect economic development after the introduction of agriculture, the availability of prehistoric domesticable wild plant and animal species did not influence population density in the past two millennia other than through the timing of the Neolithic transition...The results of column 3 (OLS) and column 4 (IV) of table 2 illustrate their findings: **years since the agricultural transition has a strong, statistically significant positive effect on population density in 1500**...The magnitude of the effect is large, as a one standard deviation change in years of agriculture is associated with 63 percent of a standard deviation change in log population density in 1500 (OLS)..All of the other regressors feature much smaller standardized effects.

> They show, not only that **an earlier onset of the Neolithic transition contributed to the level of technological sophistication in the preindustrial world**, but also that **the effect of Diamond’s biogeographic factors may well operate through the legacy of an early exposure to agriculture**," (pp.7-8).

# Population Density

- Population density is a good proxy for economic development

- Better than wages or real incomes

- Malthusian dynamics of a pre-modern economy
    - More prosperous regions have high population, which lowers real wages

- Population is also easier to measure and get data for than real wages!
