# Aid for Growth

.pull-left[

- We restrict our exploration to **foreign aid for the purpose of causing economic growth/development**

- NOT aid for humanitarian crises or natural disaster recovery

- NOT aid for military/peacekeeping efforts

- NOT aid for specific causes (i.e. reduce malaria)
    - Note these might be related to economic growth!

This should be done in global collaboration with national and local communities, taking local circumstances into account. The evidence bears out this approach."

&gt; Across the board, the post-2000 improvements in public health in sub-Saharan Africa have been dramatic, strongly supported by scaled-up aid. Up to 10 million HIV-infected individuals are now receiving life-saving, anti-retroviral medicines thanks at least in part to aid programs. Tuberculosis (TB) patients are being treated and cured, with a global TB mortality rate drop of 45 percent since 1990, and an estimated 22 million people alive due to TB care and control from 1995-2012, thanks to Global Fund support, which provides the lion’s share of donor financing to fight TB. With increased donor support, antenatal health visits, institutional deliveries, and access to emergency obstetrical care are all on the increase, contributing to a decline in sub-Saharan Africa’s maternal mortality rate (the annual number of female deaths per 100,000 live births) from 850 in 1990 to 740 in 2000 to 500 in 2010. Deaths of children under five worldwide have declined from 12.6 million a year in 1990 and 10.8 million in 2000 to 6.5 million in 2012."

&gt; These successes demonstrate a key lesson: that well-designed aid programs with sound operating principles, including clear goals, metrics, milestones, deliverables, and financing streams, can make an enormous difference, and that such programs should be devised and applied on a large scale in order to benefit as many people as possible. Such quality design needs to be based on the details of best practices, such as the combination of medicines, bed nets, and diagnostics used in cutting-edge, community-based malaria control."

# Burnside and Dollar (2000): Aid, Policies, and Growth

&gt; "We find that aid has a positive impact on growth in developing countries with goodfiscal, monetary, and trade policies but has little effect in the presence of poor policies. Good policies are ones that are themselves importantfor growth. The quality of policy has only a small impact on the allocation of aid. Our results suggest that aid would be more effective if it were more systematically conditioned on good policy," (p.847)

# Easterly, Levine, and Roodman (2003): Comment I

&gt; "The Burnside and Dollar (2000, AER) finding that aid raises growth in a good policy environment has had an important influence on policy and academic debates. We conduct a data gathering exercise that updates their data from 1970 -93 to 1970 -97, as well as filling in missing data for the original period 1970 -93. We find that the Burnside and Dollar (2002, AER) finding is not robust to the use of this additional data," (p.1).

# Djankov et. al (2008): The Curse of Aid I

&gt; "Foreign aid provides a windfall of resources to recipient countries and may result in the same rent seeking behavior as documented in the "curse of natural resources" literature. In this paper we discuss this effect and document its magnitude. Using panel data for 108 recipient countries in the period 1960-1999, we find that foreign aid has a negative impact on institutions. In particular, if the foreign aid over GDP that a country receives over a period of 5 years reaches the 75th percentile in the sample, then a 10-point index of democracy is reduced between 0.5 and almost one point, a large effect. For comparison, we also measure the effect of oil rents on political institutions. We find that aid is a bigger curse than oil," (p.169).

&gt; "A government that was irresponsible before the adjustment loan has unchanged incentives to be irresponsible after the adjustment loan. Only a change from a bad government to a good government will truly change policies. An unchanged irresponsible government will create the *illusion* of adjustment without doing the real thing. Even when donors enforce the reductions in the budget deficit, fore example, the irresponsible government has every incentive to do creative fiscal accounting to avoid real adjustment," (p. 111).

&gt; "Paradoxically, the poor in the recipient country will be better off if the aid disbursement decision is delegated to a hard-hearted agency that doesn't care about the poor. This Scrooge agency can credibly threaten to withhold aid if the recipient does not meet the conditions and alleviate poverty. The recipient will then meet the conditions, and the poor will benefit," (p. 116).

&gt; "Disregard of reality promotes erosion of language, which promotes further disregard of reality...If a country is officially designated as democratic or as a people’s republic, we know that it is one in which people have no say in the government. Another category of examples is the treatment of countries and other collectivities as if they were single decision-making entities, or entities within which all the people have identical interests, experiences, and conditions. The aggregation of two-thirds of mankind as the Third World is a conspicuous example." (p.25)

&gt; "Time and again the guilt merchants envisage the Third World as an undifferentiated, passive entity, helplessly at the mercy of its environment and of the powerful West.

&gt; The exponents of Western guilt further patronize the Third World by sug- gesting that its economic fortunes past, present, and prospective, are deter- mined by the West; that past exploitation by the West explains Third World backwardness; that manipulation of international trade by the West and other forms of Western misconduct account for persistent poverty; that the economic future of the Third World depends largely on Western donations. According to this set of ideas, whatever happens to the Third World is largely our doing." (p.72)

&gt; "It is foreign aid which has brought into existence the Third World (also called the [Global] South) and which thus underlies the so-called North-South dialogue or confrontation. Foreign aid is a source of the North-South conflict, not its solution. Take away foreign aid, and there is no Third World or South as aggregate. A further pervasive consequence of aid has been to promote or exacerbate the politicisation of life in aid-receiving countries. These major results have been damaging to both the West and the peoples of the less developed world." (p.42)

&gt; "The greatest event in the history of the nineteenth century...was the development of foreign investment," (p. 407).

&gt; "Foreign investment meant that British capitalists invested British capital in other parts of the world. They first invested it in those European countries which, from the point of view of Great Britain, were short of capital and backward in their development. It is a well known fact that the railroads of most European countries, and also of the United States, were build with the aid of British capital...The gas companies of Europe were also British...In the same way, British capital developed...many branches of industry in the United States," (p.80-81).

&gt; "And of course, as long as a country imports capital its balance of trade is what the noneconomists call “unfavorable.” This means that it has an excess of imports over exports...British factories sent many types of equipment to the United States, and this equpment was not paid for by anything other than shares of American corporations," (p.80).

&gt; "You must think of all those things that would not have come into being if there had not been any foreign investment. All the railroads, all the harbors, the factories and mines in Asia, and the Suez Canal and many other things in the Western Hemisphere, would not have been constructed had there been no foreign investment," (p.81).

# Remittances I

&gt; "The Pew Research Center keeps close tabs on remittances sent from the United States to people in other countries. In 2017, the last year for which Pew has complete data, those remittances totaled a whopping $148.5 billion. To put that number in perspective, U.S. Gross Domestic Product that year was $19.39 trillion. That means that remittances were 0.76 percent of GDP. By contrast, in 2017 the U.S. government’s spending on foreign aid, both in economic and military assistance, totaled $50.1 billion. That’s only about a third of individual remittances.

&gt; "Not surprisingly, the top 10 recipients of U.S. remittances in 2017 were all countries where the majority of people are poor by U.S. standards. Mexico led the list with receipts of $30 billion from the United States, followed by China ($16.1 billion), India ($11.7 billion), and the Philippines ($11.1 billion.)

&gt; "This demonstrates that remittances are a major form of foreign aid to people in poor countries."

# Remittances II

&gt; "Remittances sent to all countries in 2012 (developing and high income) was $534bn, three times greater than aid budgets to the developing world.

- X = 
    - Schools
    - Roads, bridges, dams
    - Sewage systems
    - Hospitals
    - etc.

- These are *consequences* of development, not necessarily *causes*!

# What Can Aid Do? II

&gt; "Under normal conditions, devoting more resources to X's production produces more X...In principles of economics classes, it is common to highlight that this relationship has nothing to do with the *economic* problem. The economic problem asks how to produce X in the least-cost way, whether to produce more or less X, and indeed, whether to produce any X at all given the alternative uses of the inputs required to produce it. 

&gt; "Solving the economic problem determines whether a country's economy develops. It is strange, then, that professional economists have had trouble distinguishing the positive relationship between inputs and outputs from solving the economic problem when it comes to evaluating foreign ," (p.391)

# What Can Aid Do? III


&gt; "Foreign aid's advocates claim aid has been successful. Aid's critics claim aid has failed. We explain why both camps are correct. Aid can, and in a few cases has, increased a particular output by devoting more resources to its production. In this sense, aid has occasionally had limited success. However, aid cannot, and has not, contributed to the solution of economic problems and therefore economic growth. In this much more important sense, aid has failed," (p.392).
