# Aid for Growth

.pull-left[

- We restrict our exploration to **foreign aid for the purpose of causing economic growth/development**

- NOT aid for humanitarian crises or natural disaster recovery

- NOT aid for military/peacekeeping efforts

- NOT aid for specific causes (i.e. reduce malaria)
    - Note these might be related to economic growth!

This should be done in global collaboration with national and local communities, taking local circumstances into account. The evidence bears out this approach."

&gt; Across the board, the post-2000 improvements in public health in sub-Saharan Africa have been dramatic, strongly supported by scaled-up aid. Up to 10 million HIV-infected individuals are now receiving life-saving, anti-retroviral medicines thanks at least in part to aid programs. Tuberculosis (TB) patients are being treated and cured, with a global TB mortality rate drop of 45 percent since 1990, and an estimated 22 million people alive due to TB care and control from 1995-2012, thanks to Global Fund support, which provides the lion’s share of donor financing to fight TB. With increased donor support, antenatal health visits, institutional deliveries, and access to emergency obstetrical care are all on the increase, contributing to a decline in sub-Saharan Africa’s maternal mortality rate (the annual number of female deaths per 100,000 live births) from 850 in 1990 to 740 in 2000 to 500 in 2010. Deaths of children under five worldwide have declined from 12.6 million a year in 1990 and 10.8 million in 2000 to 6.5 million in 2012."

&gt; These successes demonstrate a key lesson: that well-designed aid programs with sound operating principles, including clear goals, metrics, milestones, deliverables, and financing streams, can make an enormous difference, and that such programs should be devised and applied on a large scale in order to benefit as many people as possible. Such quality design needs to be based on the details of best practices, such as the combination of medicines, bed nets, and diagnostics used in cutting-edge, community-based malaria control."

# Burnside and Dollar (2000): Aid, Policies, and Growth

&gt; "We find that aid has a positive impact on growth in developing countries with goodfiscal, monetary, and trade policies but has little effect in the presence of poor policies. Good policies are ones that are themselves importantfor growth. The quality of policy has only a small impact on the allocation of aid. Our results suggest that aid would be more effective if it were more systematically conditioned on good policy," (p.847)

We conduct a data gathering exercise that updates their data from 1970 -93 to 1970 -97, as well as filling in missing data for the original period 1970 -93.

# Djankov et. al (2008): The Curse of Aid I

&gt; "Foreign aid provides a windfall of resources to recipient countries and may result in the same rent seeking behavior as documented in the "curse of natural resources" literature. In this paper we discuss this effect and document its magnitude. Using panel data for 108 recipient countries in the period 1960-1999, we find that foreign aid has a negative impact on institutions. In particular, if the foreign aid over GDP that a country receives over a period of 5 years reaches the 75th percentile in the sample, then a 10-point index of democracy is reduced between 0.5 and almost one point, a large effect. For comparison, we also measure the effect of oil rents on political institutions. We find that aid is a bigger curse than oil," (p.169).

&gt; "A government that was irresponsible before the adjustment loan has unchanged incentives to be irresponsible after the adjustment loan. Only a change from a bad government to a good government will truly change policies. An unchanged irresponsible government will create the *illusion* of adjustment without doing the real thing. Even when donors enforce the reductions in the budget deficit, fore example, the irresponsible government has every incentive to do creative fiscal accounting to avoid real adjustment," (p. 111).

&gt; "Paradoxically, the poor in the recipient country will be better off if the aid disbursement decision is delegated to a hard-hearted agency that doesn't care about the poor. This Scrooge agency can credibly threaten to withhold aid if the recipient does not meet the conditions and alleviate poverty. The recipient will then meet the conditions, and the poor will benefit," (p. 116).

&gt; "Disregard of reality promotes erosion of language, which promotes further disregard of reality...If a country is officially designated as democratic or as a people’s republic, we know that it is one in which people have no say in the government. Another category of examples is the treatment of countries and other collectivities as if they were single decision-making entities, or entities within which all the people have identical interests, experiences, and conditions. The aggregation of two-thirds of mankind as the Third World is a conspicuous example." (p.25)

&gt; "Time and again the guilt merchants envisage the Third World as an undifferentiated, passive entity, helplessly at the mercy of its environment and of the powerful West.

&gt; The exponents of Western guilt further patronize the Third World by sug- gesting that its economic fortunes past, present, and prospective, are deter- mined by the West; that past exploitation by the West explains Third World backwardness; that manipulation of international trade by the West and other forms of Western misconduct account for persistent poverty; that the economic future of the Third World depends largely on Western donations. According to this set of ideas, whatever happens to the Third World is largely our doing." (p.72)

&gt; "It is foreign aid which has brought into existence the Third World (also called the [Global] South) and which thus underlies the so-called North-South dialogue or confrontation. Foreign aid is a source of the North-South conflict, not its solution. Take away foreign aid, and there is no Third World or South as aggregate. A further pervasive consequence of aid has been to promote or exacerbate the politicisation of life in aid-receiving countries. These major results have been damaging to both the West and the peoples of the less developed world." (p.42)
