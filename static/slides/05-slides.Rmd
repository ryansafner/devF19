# An Aggregate Production Function: Implications

Under constant returns:

- Labor productivity $\left(\frac{Y}{L}\right)$, output-per-worker/hour, is determined only by $\left(\frac{K}{L}\right)$, capital-per-worker/hour

1. Output per worker grows over time

2. Capital per worker grows over time

3. The capital-to-output ratio is approximately constant over time

4. Capital and labor's share of output is approximately constant over time

5. The return to capital is approximately constant over time

6. Levels of output per person vary widely across countries

# The "Simple" Solow Model: Key Assumptions

- An aggregate Cobb-Douglas production function
- Diminishing $MP_K$
- Can accumulate physical capital $(K)$
- Technology grows **exogenously**
- Constant rate of Savings and of Investment $(s)$

- I am going to leave out excess parts of the model: role of taxes, interest rates, etc, on consumption, saving, and investment<sup>.red[1]</sup>

.footnote[<sup>.red[1]</sup> This isn't a macroeconomics course!]
---

# The "Simple" Solow Model: Equations

- $C_t+I_t=Y_t=f(K,L)$
    - Income is equal to consumption plus investment
    - Output is equal to the production function
    - Income = Output 

--

- $I_t=sf(K_t,L_t)$
    - Investment is equal to the fraction of income (output) saved $s$ times output

--

- $K_{t+1}=K_t (1-\delta) + I_t$
    - The stock of capital $K$ changes over time from depreciation $(\delta)$ and new investment $I_t$

--

- $L_t=L$
    - The stock of labor is constant over time
    
---

# The "Simple" Solow Model: Implications

- $K_{t+1}=K_t(1-\delta)+sf(K_t,L_t)$
    - Plugging equation 2 into equation 3

--

- Steady-State equilibrium: $\delta K = sf(K,L)$
    - Amount of capital depreciation is the same as the amount saved & invested

---


# Equations and Implications, in Terms of $k$

- Restate model in terms of $k \equiv \frac{K}{L}$, i.e. divide everything by $L$ to get "per worker"
  - $y = \frac{Y}{L}$, output per worker
  - $k = \frac{K}{L}$, capital per worker

--

1. $c_t+i_t=y_t=f(k_t)$

2. $i_t=sf(k_t)$

3. $k_{t+1}=k_t(1-\delta)+i_t$

--

- Implications

1. $k_{t+1}=k_t(1-\delta)+sf(k_t)$

2. Steady-State equilibrium: $\delta k = sf(k)$

# The "Simple" Solow Model and Kaldor's Facts

1. In steady state, $g_y=0$ and $g_k=0$: output and capital (per worker) do now grow!

2. The only explanation that fits with Kaldor's facts (1-2) is that all countries must be BELOW their steady states

3. Growth would have to be slowing down over time

- These are motivations for the "full Solow" model

- **Population** grows at constant rate $n$ over time

  - $g_L = n$

- **Technology** grows at constant rate $g$ over time
  - $A_{t+1}=A_t(1+g)$
  - $g_A = g$ $(g$ is the growth rate of technology)

- Redefine $k \equiv \frac{K_t}{A_tL_t}$ as capital per *effective* worker
  - Labor is being augmented by technology, hence $A_t \times L_t$
  - $A_{t+1}L_{t+1} = A_tL_t(1+n)(1+g)$

# The "Full" Solow Model II

- Long story short, our new takeaway implications:

1. $\Delta k = sf(k_t)-(\delta+n+g)k_t$
  - Capital per effective worker is equal to investment (first term) minus **break-even investment**

2. Break even investment: $(\delta+n+g)k$
  - Amount of investment necessary to keep $k$ constant, consists of:
      - $\delta k$: to replace capital depreciation
      - $nk$: to provide capital to new workers
      - $gk$: to provide capital for new "effective workers" created by technology

3. Capital and output grow at the same rate over time (Kaldor's Fact 3)

4. Capital and labor's share of output $(\alpha$ and $1-\alpha$, respectively) do not change over time (Kaldor's Fact 4)

5. The return to capital is constant (it can be shown to be $r=\alpha(k^*)^{\alpha-1}$)

$$k(t) \approx k^* + e^{-[1-\alpha k^*](n+g+\delta) t}(k_0-k^*)$$

> "By the early twentieth century, British textile equipment manufacturers were shipping power looms and other textile equipment around the globe. Mills in India, China, and elsewhere not only used the same equipment as British mills, but they were often run by experienced British managers aided by British master weavers and spinners and engineers. Nevertheless, their output per worker was far less than that of the English or American mills because their workers -- using the exact same machines -- lacked the same knowledge and skills. Western weavers were 6.5 times more productive. The English and American cotton textile industries held a sustained economic advantage for decades, despite paying much higher wages," (pp.18-19).

# The Solow Model: Growth Accounting I

$$g_Y=\frac{F_A A}{Y}*g_A+ \alpha g_K+(1-\alpha)g_L$$

- Output growth $g_Y$ can be explained as the growth of "technology" $g_A$ and the growth of factors $(\alpha g_K + (1-\alpha)g_L)$<sup>.red[1]</sup>

--

- Used to determine how much of total output can be explained by growth in factors and "everything else," known as the .shout[Solow Residual] - often interpreted as "technology" 

--

- We can directly measure (roughly) $Y, L, K$ and $\alpha$, but not $\frac{F_A A}{Y}$, the Solow residual
    - Measure it as $\text{Solow Residual}=g_Y- \alpha g_K-(1-\alpha)g_L$

.footnote[<sup>.red[1]</sup> All `\\(g\\)`'s stand for growth rates, or percentage change, of the relevant variable `\\((Y, A, K, L)\\)`. See the [class notes page](/class/05-class) for a derivation of Growth Accounting based on Solow (1957)]

Solow's findings for 1909-1949 in the United States:

1. Output per worker grew by about 100%
2. Capital-to-labor ratio grew by about 30% ("capital-deepening")
3. Technology grew by about 87.5%
    - i.e. 87.5% of the growth in output per worker came from Technology; 12.5% from increases in capital per worker
4. Measure of Technology fell in a number of recession/depression years and rose during expansions -- technology is "pro-cyclical"
5. Aggregate production function displays a positive and diminishing marginal product of capital

# Macro Models In the 30 Years Since Solow (1956)

- **Ramsey-Kass-Koopmans model** (1965): Solow model with .onfire[microfoundations]!
  - Savings rate $s$ is endogenized: 
  - "infinitely-lived" utility-maximizing individuals decide to supply labor and rent capital to cost-minimizing firms in order to earn income, which they can consume and save for future periods
  - single steady state equilibrium
  - groundwork for all modern macro dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models

--

- **Overlapping Generations (Diamond) model** (1965):
  - Individuals live for 2 periods only (work and retire), determine the savings rate
  - Multiple steady state equilibria possible
  - Economy subject to dynamic inefficiency

---

# The Motivations for Romer

- Problems with how Solow models the aggregate economy:

1. "Knowledge" (TFP) has a non-rival component to it

2. Markets/aggregate production function cannot possibly be competitive and constant returns to scale
    - Market power/monopolistic competition
    - Increasing returns to scale

3. Knowledge does not grow exogenously, but is the result of market forces and optimizing choices: people and firms face incentives to create and exploit it (or not)

- Population (or labor supply) and the total stock of human capital in the population are fixed $(\bar{L}, \bar{H})$

- Four factors of production:

1. Labor $L$
2. Physical capital $K$
  - a stock of "machines" that can be accumulated
  - diminishing returns
3. Human capital $H$
  - rivalrous, embodied in $L$ and $K$
4. Technology $A$
  - nonrival, exists beyond individuals, grow indefinitely
  - a stock, like $K$, that can be accumulated
  - no restrictions on returns!
  - measured as countable "new designs" for capital

# Romer Model: Assumptions II

- The economy has three sectors:

1. **Research sector**
    - Uses inputs $H$ and the existing stock of knowledge $A_{t-1}$ to produce new knowledge, $A_t$
    - Measured in "new designs" for capital $K$

--

2. **Intermediate goods sector**
    - Takes inputs $H$ and $A_t$ to produce $K$ for use in final goods sector

--

3. **Final goods sector**
    - uses $L$, $H$, and $K$ to produce final output $Y$

--

- Output can be consumed, or saved (to be used to make new capital, $K)$:
    $$Y_t=C_t+S_t$$

- Fixed supply of human capital is allocated to research sector or manufacturing based on relative manufacturing wages and return to new designs
$$\bar{H}=H_A+H_Y$$

---

# The Nature of "Knowledge" I

.pull-left[
- Knowledge $(A)$ is a stock that can be accumulated, like physical capital $(K)$

- To produce new knowledge, you need to use the existing stock of knowledge
    - i.e. need the idea of gravity to get relativity, we need both to get quantum mechanics, etc.

- In the model's equilibrium (p.S88):

1. Consumers decide between $C$ and $S$ based on interest rate $r$

2. Holders of $H$ decide whether to work in Research sector $(H_A)$ or in Manufacturing $(H_Y)$ based on existing stock of knowledge $A$, price of designs, and wages in manufacturing

3. Final goods producers choose cost-minimizing inputs of $L$, $H$, and $K$

4. Each firm owning $A$ (designs) sets prices to maximize profit given interest rate and market demand curves in final product market

5. Potential entrants to market consider price of designs in entry decision

6. Supply equals demand for each good

# Romer Model: Growth Rate

- As in full Solow model, growth rate of output per worker $\frac{Y}{L}$ is the growth rate of knowledge $(A)$, i.e. $g$

- Main problem with Solow (exogenous) growth model(s): $g$ is assumed as a constant number

- Romer *endogenizes* $g$, sp how does it grow?

--

$$g=\frac{\delta H - \Lambda \rho}{\sigma \Lambda + 1}$$

- $\Lambda = \frac{\alpha}{(1-\alpha-\beta)(\alpha+\beta)}$<sup>.red[1]</sup>
- $\delta$: a productivity parameter (of $H)$
- $\rho$: discount rate (from Ramsey-Kass-Koopmans model)
- $\sigma$: growth rate of utility (from Ramsey-Kass-Koopmans model)

# Romer Model Implication I - R&D Is Critical

- Economies tend to undersupply human capital to research:

> The most obvious reason is that research has positive external effects. An additional design raises the productivity of all future individuals who do research, but because this benefit is nonexcludable, it is not reflected at all in the market price for designs. The second and an equally important reason...is that research produces an input that is purchased by a sector that engages in monopoly pricing. The markup of price over marginal cost forces a wedge between the marginal social product of an input used in this sector and its market compensation," (p.S96)

--

- Policy implications:

> "Within the confines of the model, the social optimum can be achieved by subsidizing the accumulation of A," (p.S97)

> "A subsidy to physical capital accumulation may be a very poor substitute for direct subsidies that increase the incentive to undertake research. In the absence of feasible policies that can remove the divergence between the social and private returns to research, a second-best policy would be to subsidize the accumulation of total human capital," (p.S99)

---

# Romer Model Implication II - Trade Liberalization

- A large population is *not* sufficient for greater technology (and thus, economic growth), it requires access to a *larger market* (division of labor)!

> If access to a large number of workers or consumers were all that mattered, having a large population would be a good substitute for trade with other nations. The model here suggests that what is important for growth is integration not into an economy with a large number of people but rather into one with a large amount of human capital, (p.S98)

> "The most interesting positive implication of the model is that an economy with a larger total stock of human capital will experience faster growth. This finding suggests that free international trade can act to speed up growth. It also suggests a way to understand what it is about developed economies in the twentieth century that permitted rates of growth of income per capita that are unprecedented in human history. The model also suggests that low levels of human capital may help explain why growth is not observed in underdeveloped economies that are closed and why a less developed economy with a very large population can still benefit from economic integration with the rest of the world," (p.S99)

# One Test of the Model: "Market Access" Literature

- Sokoloff (1988): counties in the U.S. in the 19<sup>th</sup> century that had access to navigable waterways had higher rates of patenting (proxy for innovation, adding to $A)$ than those that did not
    - Even clearer: counties that *gained* access to new waterway (i.e. a new canal) saw sharp increase in patenting!
