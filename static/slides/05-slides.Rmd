# Real Productivity

- The **only** way to increase income and standards of living (i.e. GDP per capita) is to increase .shout[real productivity], the amount of output produced per unit of input (i.e. per work-hour)

- Recall the idea of a .shout[production function]:
$$Y=f(L,K)$$

- where $Y$ is output, $L$ is labor, and $K$ is capital (both inputs)

---

# An Aggregate Production Function

.pull-left[
- Consider an **aggregate production function** for a country's entire economy:<sup>.red[1]</sup>

$$Y=f(A,eL,K)$$
- where the factors of production (inputs) are:
    - $A$: technology
    - $e$: education ("human capital")
    - $L$: labor (population)
    - $K$: physical capital

# Output Per Worker


- A common way to measure .shout[real (labor) productivity] is output per worker
    - Simply divide the production function through by $L$

$$\frac{Y}{L}=f(\frac{A}{L}, e, \frac{K}{L})$$

- $\frac{Y}{L}$: output per worker (labor productivity) 
- Comes from having higher levels of 
    - $\frac{K}{L}$: capital per worker
    - $\frac{A}{L}$: technology per worker
    - $e$: human capital/education

  "Labor (L)", "Laborers", "Wages",

) %>%

- "A" is called .onfire[total factor productivity], augments all factors to improve output
    - Often called "technology" but more like "ideas, incentives, and institutions"

.footnote[<sup>.red[1]</sup> Technically this concept is borrowed from microeconomics, where it describes a firm's "technology."]

# Theoretical Microfoundations I

- $N$ firms $(i=1,2,\cdots N)$ all have the **same** production technology
$$y_i=a*f(L_i,K_i,T_i)$$


- All firms minimize cost of production and face the same factor prices:<sup>.red[1]</sup>

# An Aggregate Production Function: Implications

Under constant returns:

- If two countries have the same technology, there is no economic advantage to size

- Labor productivity $\left(\frac{Y}{L}\right)$, output-per-worker/hour, is determined only by $\left(\frac{K}{L}\right)$, capital-per-worker/hour

$$Y = MP_LL + MP_KK + MP_T T$$

- With competitive markets, firms pay each factor its marginal product, firms earn no profits<sup>.red[1]</sup>

1. Output per worker grows over time

2. Capital per worker grows over time

3. The capital-to-output ratio is approximately constant over time

4. Capital and labor's share of output is approximately constant over time

5. The return to capital is approximately constant over time

6. Levels of output per person vary widely across countries

# The "Simple" Solow Model: Key Assumptions

- An aggregate Cobb-Douglas production function
- Diminishing $MP_K$
- Can accumulate physical capital $(K)$
- Technology grows **exogenously**
- Constant rate of Savings and of Investment $(s)$

- I am going to leave out excess parts of the model: role of taxes, interest rates, etc, on consumption, saving, and investment<sup>.red[1]</sup>

.footnote[<sup>.red[1]</sup> This isn't a macroeconomics course!]
---

# The "Simple" Solow Model: Equations

1. $C_t+I_t=Y_t=f(K,L)$
    - Income is equal to consumption plus investment
    - Output is equal to the production function
    - Income = Output 

--

2. $I_t=sf(K_t,L_t)$
    - Investment is equal to the amount of income (output) saved $s$

--

3. $K_{t+1}=K_t (1-\delta) + I_t$
    - The stock of capital $K$ changes over time from depreciation $(\delta)$ and new investment $I$

--

4. $L_t=L$
    - The stock of labor is constant over time
    
---

# The "Simple" Solow Model: Implications

1. $K_{t+1}=K_t(1-\delta)+sf(K_t,L_t)$
    - Plugging equation 2 into equation 3

--

2. Steady-State equilibrium: $\delta K = sf(K,L)$
    - Savings rate is equal to depreciation rate

---


# Equations and Implications, in Terms of $k$

- Restate model in terms of $k \equiv \frac{K}{L}$, i.e. divide everything by $L$ to get "per worker"
  - $y = \frac{Y}{L}$, output per worker
  - $k = \frac{K}{L}$, capital per worker

--

1. $c_t+i_t=y_t=f(k_t)$

2. $i_t=sf(k_t)$

3. $k_{t+1}=k_t(1-\delta)+i_t$

--

- Implications

1. $k_{t+1}=k_t(1-\delta)+sf(k_t)$

2. Steady-State equilibrium: $\delta k = sf(k)$

# The "Simple" Solow Model and Kaldor's Facts

1. In steady state, $g_y=0$ and $g_k=0$: output and capital (per worker) do now grow!

2. The only explanation that fits with Kaldor's facts (1-2) is that all countries must be BELOW their steady states

3. Growth would have to be slowing down over time

- These are motivations for the "full Solow" model

---

# The "Full" Solow Model I

- Add two new "laws of motion" beyond just capital: 

- **Population** grows at constant rate $n$ over time
  - $L_{t+1}=L_t(1+n)$
  - $g_L = n$

- **Technology** grows at constant rate $g$ over time
  - $A_{t+1}=A_t(1+g)$
  - $g_A = g$ $(g$ is the growth rate of technology)

- Redefine $k \equiv \frac{K_t}{A_tL_t}$ as capital per *effective* worker
  - Labor is being augmented by technology, hence $A_t \times L_t$
  - $A_{t+1}L_{t+1} = A_tL_t(1+n)(1+g)$

---

# The "Full" Solow Model II

- Long story short, our new takeaway implications:

1. $\Delta k = sf(k_t)+[1-(\delta+n+g)]k_t$
  - Capital per effective worker is equal to investment (first term) minus **break-even investment**

2. Break even investment: $(\delta+n+g)k$
  - Amount of investment necessary to keep $k$ constant, consists of:
      - $\delta k$: to replace capital depreciation
      - $nk$: to provide capital to new workers
      - $gk$: to provide capital for new "effective workers" created by technology

- Whenever .green[Investment] $=$ .red[Break-even Investment]

2. Capital per worker grows at rate $g$ (Kaldor's Fact 2)

3. Capital and output grow at the same rate over time (Kaldor's Fact 3)

4. Capital and labor's share of output $(\alpha$ and $1-\alpha$, respectively) do not change over time (Kaldor's Fact 4)

5. The return to capital is constant (it can be shown to be equal to $\alpha(k^*)^{\alpha-1}$)

> "By the early twentieth century, British textile equipment manufacturers were shipping power looms and other textile equipment around the globe. Mills in India, China, and elsewhere not only used the same equipment as British mills, but they were often run by experienced British managers aided by British master weavers and spinners and engineers. Nevertheless, their output per worker was far less than that of the English or American mills because their workers -- using the exact same machines -- lacked the same knowledge and skills. Western weavers were 6.5 times more productive. The English and American cotton textile industries held a sustained economic advantage for decades, despite paying much higher wages," (pp.18-19).

> "[T]he technical knowledge needed to install, manage, and operate this technology, along with the necessary institutiosn and organizations to allow large numbers of workers to acquire this knowledge, did not appear in these countries for many decades. Cotton textile workers in China, India, and Japan in 1910 had the same machines as those in England, but their productivity was far less than that of the English or American workers because they lacked the same knowledge and skills. Even when English managers ran mills in India and China, productivity tended to be low because the English managers had to adapt their knowledge to a different environment and culture.," (p.98).

# The Solow Model: Growth Accounting I

$$g_Y=\frac{F_A A}{Y}*g_A+ \alpha g_K+(1-\alpha)g_L$$

- Output growth $g_Y$ can be explained as the growth of "technology" $g_A$ and the growth of factors $(\alpha g_K + (1-\alpha)g_L)$<sup>.red[1]</sup>

- Used to determine how much of total output can be explained by growth in factors and "everything else," known as the .shout[Solow Residual] - often interpreted as "technology" 

- We can directly measure (roughly) $Y, L, K$ and $\alpha$, but not $\frac{F_A A}{Y}$, the Solow residual
    - Measure it as $\text{Solow Residual}=g_Y- \alpha g_K-(1-\alpha)g_L$

.footnote[<sup>.red[1]</sup> All `\\(g\\)`'s stand for growth rates, or percentage change, of the relevant variable `\\((Y, A, K, L)\\)`. See the [class notes page](/class/05-class) for a derivation of Growth Accounting based on Solow (1957)]

Economics Nobel 1987

.right-column[

Solow's findings for 1909-1949 in the United States:

1. Output per worker grew by about 100%
2. Capital-to-labor ratio grew by about 30% ("capital-deepening")
3. Technology grew by about 87.5%
    - i.e. 87.5% of the growth in output per worker came from Technology; 12.5% from increases in capital per worker
4. Measure of Technology fell in a number of recession/depression years and rose during expansions -- technology is "pro-cyclical"
5. Aggregate production function displays a positive and diminishing marginal product of capital
