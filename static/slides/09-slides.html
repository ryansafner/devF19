The vices of mankind are active and able ministers of depopulation. They are the precursors in the great army of destruction, and often finish the dreadful work themselves. But should they fail in this war of extermination, sickly seasons, epidemics, pestilence, and plague advance in terrific array, and sweep off their thousands and tens of thousands. Should success be still incomplete, gigantic inevitable famine stalks in the rear, and with one mighty blow levels the population with the food of the world."

- Classical economist like Ricardo: assume diminishing returns to land, and land is a *fixed* factor

- Two Malthusian implications

1. Population increases with living standards
  - suppose technology improves agricultural productivity
  - higher wages and incomes, people are wealthier and can support more children
  - hence, population grows

2. Living standards decline with population
  - A growing population with a fixed supply of land with diminishing returns implies living standards eventually decrease
  - population will die off and return to subsistence equilibrium

- In sum: living standards and population are inversely proportional!
  - you can think GDP per capita `\(=\frac{GDP}{population}\)` where `\(population\)` is increasing!

# Malthusian Economies VI

&gt; "This   paper   examines   the   central   hypothesis   of   the   influential   Malthusian  theory,  according  to  which  improvements  in  the  tech-nological  environment  during  the  preindustrial  era  had  generated  only temporary gains in income per capita, eventually leading to a larger, but not significantly richer, population. Exploiting exogenous sources of cross-country variations in land productivity and the level of  technological  advancement,  the  analysis  demonstrates  that,  in  accordance  with  the  theory,  technological  superiority  and  higher  land productivity had significant positive effects on population den-sity but insignificant effects on the standard of living, during the time period 1–1500 CE."

"For most of our history we supported ourselves by hunting and gathering: we hunted wild animals and foraged for wild plants. It's a life that philosophers have traditionally regarded as nasty, brutish, and short. Since no food is grown and little is stored, there is (in this view) no respite from the struggle that starts anew each day to find wild foods and avoid starving...[The question] "Why did almost all our hunter-gatherer ancestors adopt agriculture?" is silly. Of course they adopted it because agriculture is an efficient way to get more food for less work. Planted crops yield far more tons per acre than roots and berries."

"There are at least three sets of reasons to explain the findings that agriculture was bad for health. First, hunter-gatherers enjoyed a varied diet, while early farmers obtained most of their food from one or a few starchy crops. The farmers gained cheap calories at the cost of poor nutrition, (today just three high-carbohydrate plants — wheat, rice, and corn — provide the bulk of the calories consumed by the human species, yet each one is deficient in certain vitamins or amino acids essential to life.) Second, because of dependence on a limited number of crops, farmers ran the risk of starvation if one crop failed. Finally, the mere fact that agriculture encouraged people to clump together in crowded societies, many of which then carried on trade with other crowded societies, led to the spread of parasites and infectious disease. (Some archaeologists think it was the crowding, rather than agriculture, that promoted disease, but this is a chicken-and-egg argument, because crowding encourages agriculture and vice versa.) Epidemics couldn't take hold when populations were scattered in small bands that constantly shifted camp. Tuberculosis and diarrheal disease had to await the rise of farming, measles and bubonic plague the appearance of large cities."

# People as Stomachs vs. Brains

&gt; "The nonrivalry of technology, as modeled in the endogenous growth literature, implies that high population spurs technological change. This paper constructs and empirically tests a model of long-run world population growth combining this implication with the Malthusian assumption that technology limits population. The model predicts that over most of history, the growth rate of population will be proportional to its level. Empirical tests support this prediction and show that historically, among societies with no possibility for technological contact, those with larger initial populations have had faster technological change and population growth," (p.681)


&gt; "[H]olding constant the share of resources devoted to research, an increase in population leads to an increase in technological change...This paper argues that the long-run history of population growth and technological change is consistent with the population implications of models of endogenous technological change...even if each person's research productivity is independent of population, total research output will increase with population due to the nonrivalry of technology. As Kuznets [1960] and Simon [1977, 1981] argue, a higher population means more potential inventors.," (p.681-684)

# State Capacity: Definitions from Literature

&gt; "State capacity can be thought of as comprising two components. First, a high capacity state must be able to enforce its rules across the entirety of the territory it claims to rule (legal capacity). Second, it has to be able to garner enough tax revenues from the economy to implement its policies (fiscal capacity). State capacity then should be distinguished from either the size or the scope of the state. A state with a bloated and inefficient public sector may be comparatively ineffective at implementing policies and raising tax revenues. Furthermore, historians agree that the eighteenth century British state had high state capacity even though it played a very limited role in the economy. Similarly, state capacity requires a degree of political and legal centralization, but it should not be identified with political centralization *per se,*" (p.2).

&gt; Most early measures were human in scale. One sees this logic at work in such surviving expressions as a "stone's throw" or "within ear&lt;ad&gt; shot" for distances and a "cartload," a "basketful," or a "handful" for volume. Given that the size of a cart or basket might vary from place to place and that a stone's throw might not be precisely uniform from person to person, these units of measurement varied geographically and temporally.

&gt; **Because local standards of measurement were tied to practical needs**, because they reflected particular cropping patterns and agricultural technology, because they varied with climate and ecology, because they were **"an attribute of power and an instrument of asserting class privilege,"** and because they were **"at the center of bitter class struggle," they represented a mind-boggling problem for statecraft.**

&gt; A good part of the **politics of measurement** sprang from what a contemporary economist might call **the "stickiness" of feudal rents.** Noble and clerical claimants often found it **difficult to increase feudal dues directly**; the levels set for various charges were the **result of long struggle,** and even a small increase above the customary level was viewed as a **threatening breach of tradition.** Adjusting the measure, however, represented a roundabout way of achieving the same end.

&gt; The local lord might, for example, lend grain to peasants in smaller baskets and insist on repayment in larger baskets. He might surreptitiously or even boldly enlarge the size of the grain sacks accepted for milling (a monopoly of the domain lord) and reduce the size of the sacks used for measuring out flour; he might also collect feudal dues in larger baskets and pay wages in kind in smaller baskets. While the formal custom governing feudal dues and wages would thus remain intact (requiring, for example, the same number of sacks of wheat from the harvest of a given holding), the actual transaction might increasingly favor the lord. The results of such fiddling were far from trivial. Kula estimates that the size of the bushel (boisseau) used to collect the main feudal rent (taille) increased by one-third between 1674 and 1716 as part of what was called the reaction feodale.

&gt; "Absolutist France in the seventeenth century is a case in point. **Indirect taxes-excise levies on salt and tobacco, tolls, license fees, and the sale of offices and titles-were favored forms of taxation; they were easy to administer and required little or nothing in the way of information about landholding and income.** The **tax-exempt status of the nobility and clergy meant that a good deal of the landed property was not taxed at all, transferring much of the burden to wealthy commoner farmers and the peasantry.** Common land, although it was a vitally important subsistence resource for the rural poor, yielded no revenue either."

&gt; What must strike any observer of absolutist **taxation** is how **wildly variable and unsystematic it was**...[T]he main direct land tax, the *taille*, was **frequently not paid at all** and that **no community paid more than one-third of what they were assessed.** The result was that the **state routinely relied on exceptional measures to overcome shortfalls in revenue** or to pay for new expenses, particularly military campaigns. The crown exacted "forced loans" (*rentes, droits alienes*) in return for annuities that it might or might not honor; it sold offices and titles (*venalites d'of/ices*); it levied exceptional hearth taxes (*foua ges extraordinaires*); and, worst of all, it billeted troops directly in communities, often ruining the towns in the process.

# Takeaways

.pull-left[

- Taxation is *extremely* irregular, uncertain, and profoundly unequal

- States struggle to collect any significant tax revenue

- States cannot project power beyond their capital, military garrisons

- Sharp class divisions between ruling elites and serfs

- Local communities and customs trump all other concerns - there is no "nation" or "country"
  - Nationalism is a 19^th^ century invention!
