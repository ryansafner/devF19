> EVERYBODY is talkin' these days about Tammany men growin' rich on graft, but nobody thinks of drawin' the distinction between honest graft and dishonest graft. There's all the difference in the world between the two. Yes, many of our men have grown rich in politics. I have myself. I've made a big fortune out of the game, and I'm gettin' richer every day, but I've not gone in for dishonest graft—blackmailin' gamblers, saloonkeepers, disorderly people, etc.—and neither has any of the men who have made big fortunes in politics.

# A Hypothesis to Consider

- These are characteristics of "normal countries"
    - Middle-income, still industrializing economies

        - "honest graft vs. dishonest graft?"

- Democratic, politically free countries with open access and low corruption are a *very* new thing historically!

# Quantifying Changes I

- Several ways we can talk about how a measure **changes** over time, from time $t_1 \rightarrow t_2$

- **Difference $(\Delta)$:** the difference between the value at time $t_1$ and time $t_2$
$$\Delta t=t_2-t_1$$

# Quantifying Changes II

- Several ways we can talk about how a measure **changes** over time, from time $t_1 \rightarrow t_2$

- **Difference $(\Delta)$:** the difference between the value at time $t_1$ and time $t_2$
$$\Delta t=t_2-t_1$$

- **Relative Difference**: the difference expressed in terms of the original value
$$\frac{\Delta t}{t_1} = \frac{t_2-t_1}{t_1}$$
 this becomes a proportion $(\pm$ between 0 and 1)

 this becomes a proportion $(\pm$ between 0 and 1)

- **Percentage Change (Growth Rate)**: relative difference expressed as a *percentage* $(\pm$ between 0 and 100%)

$$\begin{align*}
\% \Delta &= \frac{\Delta t}{t_1} \times 100\%\\
&=\frac{t_2-t_1}{t_1} \times 100\% \\

A country's GDP is $100 in 2017, and $120 in 2018. Calculate the country's GDP growth rate for 2018:

$$\begin{align*}
\text{GDP Growth Rate}_{2018} &= \frac{GDP_{2018}-GDP_{2017}}{GDP_{2017}} \times 100\% \\

    - A 2% increase from 100 is an increase of 2
    - A 2% increase from 1000 is an increase of 20!

However, we believe there is a general pattern to be found between the adoption of the institutions that promote the wealth of a nation and the health and well-being of its people. In other words, life expectancy, infant mortality, educational opportunities, and health outcomes are well correlated with GDP" (p.110).

> "Our first conjecture is that the rule of law is a significant factor in explaining economic development. This is hardly controversial...Our second conjecture is that economic development is a significant factor in determining increases in what Sen entitles human capabilities... (p.111).

> "In short, we expect that the rule of law will increase the level of de- velopment, and the level of development will lead to improvements in human capabilities. That is, the rule of law is an institutional fea- ture that promotes economic development that, in turn, leads to in- creases in those capabilities that Nussbaum and Sen argue are neces- sary for living a human life. Economic development, in short, provides the material pre-requisites that enable human flourishing," (p.112).

# Basic Human Needs Approach

Gordon's proposed poverty threshold is defined as **2 or more deprivations** of:

- **Food deprivation**: Body mass index less than 18.5
- **Water deprivation**:access only to unimproved source such as open wells, open springs or surface water or who have to walk for more than 15 minutes to their water source (30 minutes round-trip)
- **Deprivation of sanitation facilities**: access only to unimproved sanitation facilities
- **Health deprivation**: Treatment not recieved for pregnancy, serious illnesses, no knowledge of safe sex practices (esp. HIV/AIDS)
- **Shelter deprivation**: living in dwellings with 3 or more people per room (overcrowding) or in a house with no flooring (e.g. a mud floor) or inadequate roofing (e.g. natural roofing materials)
- **Education deprivation**: youth who did not complete primary school or who are illiterate
- **Information deprivation**: no access to a radio or television (i.e. broadcast media) at home
