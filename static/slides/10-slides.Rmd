- Countries aren't poor out of ignorance or laziness

- Institutions $\rightarrow$ outcomes, and politics (the distribution of wealth and power) $\rightarrow$ institutions

- Development and political-economic reform of institutions must be .shout[incentive-compatible]

- In other words, countries remain poor because .onfire[it is not in the interest of the elites to develop the country]

> "To starkly illustrate our framework, consider a society in which there are two groups: an elite and the citizens. Nondemocracy is rule by the elite; democracy is rule by the more numerous groups who constitute the majority–in this case, the citizens. In nondemocracy, the elite gets the policies it wants; in democracy, the citizens have more power to get what they want. Because the elite loses under democracy, it naturally has an incentive to oppose or subvert it; yet, most democracies arise when they are created by the elite," (p.10).

# Recall AJR: *Political* Losers Block Development

> "We argue that the effect of economic change on political power is a key factor in determining whether technological advances and beneficial economic changes will be blocked. In other words, we propose a "political-loser hypothesis." We argue that it is groups whose political power (not economic rents) is eroded who will block technological advances. If agents are economic losers but have no political power, they cannot impede technological progress. If they have and maintain political power (i.e., are not political losers), then they have no incentive to block progress. It is therefore agents who have political power and fear losing it who will have incentives to block. Our analysis suggests that we should look more to the nature of political institutions and the determinants of the distribution of political power if we want to understand technological backwardness," (pp.126-127).

- Citizens (in principle) sign a **social contract**, i.e. a "**constitution**" that deliberately restricts their liberties

- In exchange, we empower the State as our agent to punish those of us that fail to uphold the social contract

- **Politics**: decisions under rules which we agree are legitimate that determine an outcome for all of us, even if we *disagree* (or are harmed by) the outcome

- No formal administration, staff, etc; all private servants to King's household

# Weak States Struggle to Project Power

> They had locally appointed officials – an agent to collect taxes and a guard to police the community. But laws, especially those relating to inheritance, were widely ignored and direct contact with the central power was extremely limited.

> The state was perceived as a dangerous nuisance: its emissaries were soldiers who had to be fed and housed, bailiffs who seized property and lawyers who settled property disputes and took most of the proceeds.

> Being French was not a source of personal pride, let alone the basis of a common identity. Before the mid-nineteenth century, few people had seen a map of France and few had heard of Charlemagne and Joan of Arc.

> France was effectively a land of foreigners.

  - Provide more private goods to $W$ than the Leader!

- But challenger faces a .shout[commitment problem]
  - Current $W$ members obtain private rents because they are in $W$
  - If $C$ comes to power, members of $W$ continue to earn rents *only if they are still in* $W$ under $C$'s leadership!
  - $C$ can promise a member $W_i$ that they will be in the new $W$ under $C$, but this promise is not *credible!*

- Current $W$ members recognize they keep getting rents only so long as they remain loyal to $L$

  - Since $W<S$, defectors can't be certain they'll be in $W$

  - (Expected) **marginal benefit of defecting:** being in $W$ under $C$
  - (Expected) **marginal cost of defecting**: in $W$ now under $L$, but not being in $W$ under $C$

- As $W \uparrow$ or $\downarrow S$, $C$ is less likely to need any particular member $W_i$ (and less likely to include them in new regime)
  - Defecting becomes risker<sup>1</sup>

- Risk of *not* being in $W$ is $(1-\frac{W}{S})$

.pull-right[

In these circumstances [after the rebellion on An Lu-Shan from 756 to 763 AD] the emperors could look for loyal service to one source and one alone - their eunuchs. For eunuchs were absolutely and unconditionally loyal to the emperors. This indeed is true, not only for the Chinese Empire, but for all the others that used the services of eunuchs - Persia, late Rome, Byzantium. Eunuchs had neither lands nor fortunes nor families to fall back upon. To the generals they were half-men, to the mandarines guttersnipes with neither the breeding nor the education of a gentleman. The Emperor, therefore was their sole support and they lived or died, rose or fell, entirely by his favor," (pp. 66-67).

In countries ranking between the 75th and 90th percentiles of income—the developing world elite—the corresponding figureis 12.5.
