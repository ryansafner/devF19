- Countries aren't poor out of ignorance or laziness

- "[I]f ignorance were the problem, well-meaning leaders would quickly learn what types of policies increased their citizens' incomes and welfare, and would gravitate toward those policies." (*Why Nations Fail*, p.65).

- Institutions $\rightarrow$ outcomes, and politics (the distribution of wealth and power) $\rightarrow$ institutions

- Development and political-economic reform of institutions must be .shout[incentive-compatible]

- In other words, countries remain poor because .onfire[it is not in the interest of the elites to develop the country]

> "To starkly illustrate our framework, consider a society in which there are two groups: an elite and the citizens. Nondemocracy is rule by the elite; democracy is rule by the more numerous groups who constitute the majority–in this case, the citizens. In nondemocracy, the elite gets the policies it wants; in democracy, the citizens have more power to get what they want. Because the elite loses under democracy, it naturally has an incentive to oppose or subvert it; yet, most democracies arise when they are created by the elite," (p.10).

# Recall AJR: *Political* Losers Block Development

> "We argue that the effect of economic change on political power is a key factor in determining whether technological advances and beneficial economic changes will be blocked. In other words, we propose a "political-loser hypothesis." We argue that it is groups whose political power (not economic rents) is eroded who will block technological advances. If agents are economic losers but have no political power, they cannot impede technological progress. If they have and maintain political power (i.e., are not political losers), then they have no incentive to block progress. It is therefore agents who have political power and fear losing it who will have incentives to block. Our analysis suggests that we should look more to the nature of political institutions and the determinants of the distribution of political power if we want to understand technological backwardness," (pp.126-127).

- In exchange, we empower the State as our agent to punish those of us that fail to uphold the social contract

- **Politics**: decisions under rules which we agree are legitimate that determine an outcome for all of us, even if we *disagree* (or are harmed by) the outcome

- No formal administration, staff, etc; all private servants to King's household

# Weak States Struggle to Project Power

> They had locally appointed officials – an agent to collect taxes and a guard to police the community. But laws, especially those relating to inheritance, were widely ignored and direct contact with the central power was extremely limited.

> The state was perceived as a dangerous nuisance: its emissaries were soldiers who had to be fed and housed, bailiffs who seized property and lawyers who settled property disputes and took most of the proceeds.

> Being French was not a source of personal pride, let alone the basis of a common identity. Before the mid-nineteenth century, few people had seen a map of France and few had heard of Charlemagne and Joan of Arc.

> France was effectively a land of foreigners.
