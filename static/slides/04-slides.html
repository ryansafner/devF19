&gt; "Conditions in the Third World tend to ensure the need for a substantial volume of trading and closely related activities. These activities are more labor intensive than in the West because capital is scarcer relative to labor in poor countries than in rich.
A large proportion of producers and consumers operate on a small scale and far from the major commercial centers, including the ports. Individual transactions are small. Individual farmers produce on a small scale and sell in even smaller quantities at frequent intervals because they lack stor- age facilities and substantial cash reserves. Conversely, because of their low incomes, consumers find it convenient or necessary to buy in small, often very small, amounts, again at frequent intervals." (pp.8-9)

&gt; "To a Western audience it may seem as if sales of produce and purchases of consumer goods in such small quantities must be wasteful. This is not so...What may be somewhat surprising is that a large part of this labor is self-employed. This is so because entry into small-scale trading is easy...For these reasons small-scale operations are economic in many parts of the distribution system: large firms are at a disadvantage because their operations require more administrative and supervisory personnel, and these tend to be relatively expensive or ineffective in many poor countries. A multiplicity of small-scale traders in part represents the substitution of cheaper labor for more expensive labor," (p.9-10)

&gt; "Farmers in poor countries producing for wider exchange have to make in- vestments of various kinds. These investments include the clearing and im- provement of land and the acquisition of livestock and equipment. Such investments constitute capital formation. A part of this capital formation is financed from personal savings and borrowing from traders and others. But much of it is nonmonetized...These forms of investment, when made by small farmers, are generally omitted from official statistics and are still largely ignored in both the aca- demic and the official development literature. [But] these categories of investment are critical in the advance from subsistence to exchange." (pp.11-12)

# Social Problems that Markets Solve Well 

.pull-left[
- .onfire[Problem 1]: Resources have multiple uses that are rivalrous

- .onfire[Problem 2]: Different people have different subjective valuations for uses of resources

- .onfire[It is inefficient (immoral?) to use a resource in a way that prevents someone else who values it more from using it!]

- Solution: Prices in a functioning market accurately measure **opportunity cost** of using resources in a particular way
    - The price of a resource is the amount someone else is willing to pay to acquire it from its current use/owner

# Markets and Pareto Efficiency

.pull-left[

- Voluntary exchange is a .shout[Pareto improvement]: change in allocation that makes at least one person better off and making nobody worse off

- An allocation of resources is .shout[Pareto efficient] when there are no possible Pareto improvements

# Markets and Pareto Efficiency

.pull-left[

- Pareto efficiency is conceptual gold standard: allow all welfare-improving exchanges so long as nobody gets harmed

- In practice: Pareto efficiency is a *first best* solution
    - only takes one holdout to disapprove to violate Pareto

# Markets and Kaldor-Hicks Efficiency

.pull-left[

- .shout[Kaldor-Hicks Improvement]: an action improves efficiency its generates more social gains than losses
    - those made better off could in principle compensate those made worse off

- .shout[Kaldor-Hicks efficiency]: no potential Kaldor-Hicks improvements exist

- Keeps intuitive appeal of Pareto but more practical
    - Every Pareto improvement is a KH-improvement (but not the other way around!)
    
- Consider policies where winners' maximum WTP `\(&gt;\)` losers' minimum WTA

- Policies should **maximize social value of resources**

# Welfare Economics

- The .shout[1st Fundamental Welfare Theorem]: markets in competitive equilibrium maximize allocative efficiency of resources and are Pareto efficient

- Markets are great when they: 

1. Are .onfire[Competitive]: many buyers and many sellers

2. Reach .onfire[equilibrium]: absence of transactions costs or policies *preventing prices from adjusting* to meet supply and demand

3. .onfire[No externalities] are present: costs and benefits are fully internalized by the parties to transactions 

- If any of these conditions are not met, we have .shout[market failure]
    - May be a role for government, other institutions, or entrepreneurs to fix

    - Consumers maximized utility
    - Producers minimized cost
    - Economic profits are zero
    - No surpluses or shortages

- If you find the right vector of prices, given consumer preferences and given production functions, you can calculate this optimal outcome!

What is forgotten is that the method which under given conditions is the cheapest is a thing which has to be discovered, and to be discovered anew, sometimes almost from day to day, by the entrepreneur, and that, in spite of the strong inducement, it is by no means regularly the established entrepreneur, the man in charge of the existing plant, who will discover what is the best method," (p.196).

- **Prices are never "given"**, prices **emerge** dynamically from negotiation and market decisions of entrepreneurs and consumers

- **Competition**: is a **discovery process** which *discovers* what consumer preferences are and what technologies are lowest cost, and how to allocate resources accordingly

But a little reflection will show that there is beyond question a body of very important but unorganized knowledge which cannot possibly be called scientific in the sense of knowledge of general rules: the knowledge of the particular circumstances of time and place. It is with respect to this that practically every individual has some advantage over all others in that he possesses unique information of which beneficial use might be made, but of which use can be made only if the decisions depending on it are left to him or are made with his active cooperation," (pp.521-522).
