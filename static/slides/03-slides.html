- History not an experimental science

- Must contest systems theoretically - which is most internally-consistent?

- All "pure" systems can work in utopia with heroic assumptions (omniscience, omnipotence, benevolence)

&gt; "There are **two ways of looking at the pattern of human activities** which lead to very different conclusions concerning both its explanation and the possibilities of deliberately altering it. The first one is based on conceptions which are demonstrably false, yet are so pleasing to human vanity that they have gained great influence and are constantly employed even by people who know that they rest on a fiction...The [second]...leads in some respects to conclusions so unwelcome that few are willing to follow through to the end."

&gt; "The **first gives us a sense of unlimited power to realize our wishes, while the second leads to the insight that there are limitations to what we can deliberately bring about, and to the recognition that some of our present hopes are delusions.** Yet the effect of allowing ourselves to be deluded by the first view has always been that man has actually limited the scope of what he can achieve. For it has always been the recognition of the limits of the possible which has enabled man to make full use of his powers..." (pp.19-20)

For it is the other way around: our reason is as much the result of an evolutionary selection process as is our morality...the evolution of the extended order...is ...beyond instinct and often opposed to it, and which is...incapable of being created or designed by reason," (p. 21).

&gt; "Moreover, the structures of the extended order are made up not only of individuals but also of many, often overlapping, [groups] within which old instinctual responses, such as solidarity and altruism, continue to retain some importance by assisting voluntary collaboration...Part of our present difficulty is that **we must constantly adjust our lives, our thoughts and our emotions, in order to live simultaneously within different kinds of orders according to different rules.** If we were to apply the unmodified, uncurbed, rules of the micro-cosmos (i.e., of the small band or troop, or of, say, our families) to the macro-cosmos (our wider civilisation), as our instincts and sentimental yearnings often make us wish to do, *we would destroy it*. Yet if we were always to apply the rules of the extended order to our more intimate groupings, *we would crush them*. **So we must learn to live in two sorts of worlds at once**," (p.18)

Simultaneously, with an immense expansion of democracy, which, for the first time, becomes democracy for the poor, democracy for the people, and not democracy for the money-bags, the dictatorship of the proletariat imposes a series of restrictions on the freedom of the oppressors, the exploiters, the capitalists. We must suppress them in order to free humanity from wage slavery,their resistance must be crushed by force; it is clear that there is no freedom and no democracy where there is suppression and where there is violence," (pp.62-65).

- "Market socialism" is superior for 4 reasons:

1. It can redistribute endowments, namely toward greater equality, “so as to attain the maximum social welfare."
2. It can modify prices to correct for external effects 
3. eliminate monopoly pricing, in both ways approaching the ideal of perfect competition more closely than a market economy
4. Socialism is better able to foster technological progress

&gt; "If socialism is to be identified with the belief that the abolition of private property would automatically establish the brotherhood of man - and many socialists did, while some apparently still do - then socialism must be counted out as false," (vii).

&gt; "**Economics of Control** [takes the stress away] from collectivism and applied to the idea of conscious recognition of the problems of social organization and the exercise of conscious control over the economic system...The economics of *control* is still contrasted with the economics of *laissez fare*, but control does not necessarily mean collectivism. **It suggests the deliberate application of whatever policy will best serve the social interest**, without prejudging the issue between collective ownership and administration or some form of private enterprise," (vii-viii).

# The Socialist Calculation Debate In Retrospect I

.pull-left[
- I am omitting Mises' and (more famously) Hayek's responses to Lange and others
    - We'll see them next week in the next lesson
    - This exchange leads to new insights about the *function of market prices*

- Overall, the socialist calculation "debate" largely ended with **economists talking past each other**
    - Both sides walked away believing they had "won"

- Mises &amp; Hayek (["The Austrians"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_School)) begin to recognize that they view "prices," "equilibrium," "competition," and "efficiency" *very differently* than neoclassical economists

# The Socialist Calculation Debate In Retrospect II

Stages of the debate:

1. Marxists argue for moneyless, propertyless, centrally-planned economy as a superior system for achieving coordinated, "advanced material production" as compared to the ``anarchy'' of capitalist production
2. Mises (1920) argued that socialism cannot achieve its defined goals due to its inability to solve the economic calculation problem
3. Developments in NC-GE theory show logical/formal similarity of systems of equations between the socialist and capitalist system under static, ideal, conditions
4. Hayek extends Mises' calculation point as a problem of dispersed tacit knowledge (impossible to achieve via equation-solving) that is not *given* to any agent or system; competition and market prices enable *discovery* of optimal resource uses 
5. Lange &amp; others argue "market socialism" can approximate *perfect competition*

# The Socialist Calculation Debate In Retrospect III

.pull-left[

- Main disagreement is about **rivalry**

- **Marxists**: .onfire[rivalry as inherent flaw] in capitalism leading to conflict; central planning removes rivalry and leads to pre-coordinated harmony

- **Mises-Hayek**: .onfire[rivalry] under specific institutions (market prices, property rights) .onfire[is the only way to generate the information] necessary to rationally allocate resources

- **Neoclassical economists**: .onfire[assume rivalry away] in perfect competition models, viewing prices as just parametric statistics, allowing a central planner to achieve the same optimal outcome

# What Are Prices, Then?

.pull-left[

- This will lead into our next topic on the *microeconomics* of development

- What *are* the functions of market prices, competition, equilibrium, etc?
