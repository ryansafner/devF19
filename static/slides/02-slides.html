&gt; EVERYBODY is talkin' these days about Tammany men growin' rich on graft, but nobody thinks of drawin' the distinction between honest graft and dishonest graft. There's all the difference in the world between the two. Yes, many of our men have grown rich in politics. I have myself. I've made a big fortune out of the game, and I'm gettin' richer every day, but I've not gone in for dishonest graft—blackmailin' gamblers, saloonkeepers, disorderly people, etc.—and neither has any of the men who have made big fortunes in politics.

&gt; There's an honest graft, and I'm an example of how it works. I might sum up the whole thing by sayin': "I seen my opportunities and I took 'em."

# A Hypothesis to Consider

.pull-left[

- These are characteristics of "normal countries"
    - Middle-income, still industrializing economies
    - Endemic corruption, but can still be consistent with economic growth
        - "honest graft vs. dishonest graft?"

- Note: "normal" `\(\neq\)` "good" or "just"!

- Democratic, politically free countries with open access and low corruption are a *very* new thing historically!

# Quantifying Changes I

- Several ways we can talk about how a measure **changes** over time, from time `\(t_1 \rightarrow t_2\)`

- **Difference `\((\Delta)\)`:** the difference between the value at time `\(t_1\)` and time `\(t_2\)`
`$$\Delta t=t_2-t_1$$`

---

# Quantifying Changes II

- Several ways we can talk about how a measure **changes** over time, from time `\(t_1 \rightarrow t_2\)`

- **Difference `\((\Delta)\)`:** the difference between the value at time `\(t_1\)` and time `\(t_2\)`
`$$\Delta t=t_2-t_1$$`

- **Relative Difference**: the difference expressed in terms of the original value
`$$\frac{\Delta t}{t_1} = \frac{t_2-t_1}{t_1}$$`
 this becomes a proportion `\((\pm\)` between 0 and 1)

`$$\begin{align*}

# The Rule of 72 II

.content-box-green[
.green[**Example**:]

- If our economy is growing at **2% per year**, the economy doubles in `\(\frac{72}{2}=36\)` years

- If our economy is growing at **3% per year**, the economy doubles in `\(\frac{72}{3}=24\)` years

- If our economy is growing at **4% per year**, the economy doubles in `\(\frac{72}{4}=18\)` years

- If our economy is growing at **6% per year**, the economy doubles in `\(\frac{72}{6}=12\)` years

# The Rule of 72 III

.pull-left[
- Growth rates are **unbelievably** important!

- It makes *all the difference in the world* if we grow at 2% vs. 3% per year
    - Our economy would double in size in 36 vs. 24 years!
    
- More importantly, growth compounds! 
    - A 2% increase from 100 is an increase of 2
    - A 2% increase from 1000 is an increase of 20!

# The Rule of 72 IV

.pull-left[
.content-box-green[
.green[**Example**]: Suppose 2 countries start with the same GDP of $1 Trillion

- Country A grows at 2% per year
- Country B grows at 4% per year

- After 72 years:
    - Country A doubles twice ($4 Trillion)
    - Country B doubles four times ($16 Trillion)
        - Country B is 4x as wealthy as Country A!
