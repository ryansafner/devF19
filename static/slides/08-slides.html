- Markets &amp; price theory: how consumers and producers specialize, produce, and exchange within .onfire[given, well-functioning markets (and politics)]

  - rule of law
  - contract enforcement
  - dispute resolution
  - complete contracts
  - low or no transaction costs
  - high level of social trust

Not only will this kind of work **more closely approximate reality in the poorest, conflict-ridden countries, but it could also lead to more sensible policy**", (p.56).

The present is an instance of the assertion of that kind, as incidental to a municipal power; that of superintending the internal concerns of a State, and particularly of extending protection and patronage, in the shape of a monopoly, to genius and enterprise. 
The grant to Livingston and Fulton interferes with the freedom of intercourse, and on this principle, its constitutionality is contested.(p. 22 US 229)

# The Allocation of Talent Matters I


&gt; "A country's most talented people typically organize production by others, so they can spread their ability advantage over a larger scale. When they start firms, they innovate and foster growth, but when they become rent seekers, they only redistribute wealth and reduce growth. Occupational choice depends on returns to ability and to scale in each sector, on market size, and on compensation contracts. In most countries, rent seeking rewards talent more than entrepreneurship does, leading to stagnation. Our evidence shows that countries with a higher proportion of engineering college majors grows faster; wheras countries with a higher proportion of law concentrators grow more slowly," (p. 503)

&gt; "In many market-oriented economies, government restrictions upon economic activity are pervasive facts of life. These restrictions give rise to rents of a variety of forms, and people often compete for the rents. Sometimes, such competition is perfectly legal. In other instances, rent seeking takes other forms, such as bribery, corruption, smuggling, and black markets."

&gt; "**When quantitative restrictions are imposed upon and effectively constrain imports, an import license is a valuable commodity**...It has always been recognized that there are some costs associated with licensing: paperwork, the time spent by entrepreneurs in obtaining their licenses, the cost of the administrative apparatus necessary to issue licenses, and so on. Here, the argument is carried one step further: **in many circumstances resources are devoted to competing for those licenses**," (p.848).

&gt; "Entrepreneurs should be willing to invest resources in attempts to form a monopoly until the marginal cost equals the properly discounted return. The potential customers would also be interested in preventing the transfer and should be willing to make large investments to that end. Once the monopoly is formed, continual efforts to either break the monopoly or muscle into it would be predictable. Here again considerable resources might be invested. The holders of the monopoly, on the other hand, would be willing to put quite sizable sums into the defense of their power to receive these transfers," (p.231).

**Executive Constraints**: A **measure of the extent of institutionalized constraints on the decision making powers of chief executives.** The variable takes seven different values: (1) Unlimited authority(there are no regular limitations on the executive's actions, as distinct from irregular limitations such as the threat or actuality of coups and assassinations); (2) Intermediate category; (3) Slight to moderate limitation on executive authority (there are some real but limited restraints on the executive); (4) Intermediate category; (5) Substantial limitations on executive authority (the executive has more effective authority than any accountability group but is subject to substantial constraints by them); (6) Intermediate category; (7) Executive parity or subordination (accountability groups have effective authority equal to or greater than the executive in most areas of activity). This **variable ranges from one to seven where higher values equal a greater extent of institutionalized constraints on the power of chief executives.** This variable is **calculated as the average from 1960 through 2000**, or for specific years as needed in the tables.

- Strong feedback loops:

- under extractive institutions, political &amp; economic elite can structure institutions to maintain their wealth and power to extract rents at the expense of the population

- under inclusive institutions, more equitable distribution of wealth and power, competition prevents any one group from creating and maintaining enough rents to exert control

- institutions are maintained by elites who control power, choose economic institutions with few constraints or opposing forces to them!

- **Why would elites ever permit reform?**

# AJR: *Political* Losers, Not Economic Losers, Block Development

&gt; "There are problems with this story, however. First, despite the intuitive appeal of the idea, there are relatively few instances where major economic changewas blockedby economic losers. Mokyr (1990) emphasizes the attemptsof many skilled artisansto block the introduction of new machines.The most famous example is the Luddites,skilled weavers who were thrown out of work by mechanization. Interestingly, however, many of these groups, including the Luddites, were ultimately unable to block economic progress. Equally important, the economic-losers hypothesis relies on the presumption that certain groups have the political power to block innovation. But if so, why not use this power to simply tax the gains generated by the introductionof the new technology? This might be because there are limits on the nature of fiscal instruments,though it seems plausible that groups with sufficient political power to block innovationwould be able subsequentlyto lobby effectively for redistribution. A more important reason, however, may be that the introductionof new technology, and economic change more generally, may simultaneously affect the distributionof political power," (126).

# AJR: *Political* Losers, Not Economic Losers, Block Development

&gt; "We arguethatthe effect of economic change on political power is a key factor in determining whether technological advances and beneficial economic changes will be blocked. In other words, we propose a "political-loser hypothesis." We argue that it is groupswhose political power (not economic rents) is eroded who will block technological advances.If agents are economic losers but have no political power, they cannot impede technological progress. If they have and maintain political power (i.e., are not political losers), then they have no incentive to block progress.It is therefore agents who have political power and fear losing it who will have incentives to block. Our analysis suggests that we should look more to the nature of political institutions and the determinants of the distribution of political power if we want to understand technological backwardness," (pp.126-127)
