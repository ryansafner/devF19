<h4 id="country-profile" class="unnumbered">Country Profile</h4>
<p>Each of you will write a short profile of a different developing country and give a short presentation to the class. The countries that may be chosen will be restricted to developing economies in Latin America, Asia, Africa, and Eastern Europe. Students born outside of the U.S. may <em>not</em> choose the country of their birth. The purpose of this assignment is to “get you out of your comfort zone” and see the world from the perspective of a culture and an economy radically different than the one(s) you are familiar with.</p>
<h4 id="participation-and-discussion" class="unnumbered">Participation and Discussion</h4>
<p>At the end of most lessons, we will hold a discussion. During our discussions, we will follow the rules pioneered and perfected by the Liberty Fund seminars. I will provide you with a handout detailing the rules on the first discussion day. These discussions help shift the focus of the course away from me lecturing material at you more towards your learning and building upon material. This requires you to take ownership of your own learning. It is critical that you come to class having done the readings and are prepared for discussion. <strong>You are required to email to me a list of 2-3 questions or points you want to discuss for each discussion day.</strong> Everyone will receive a grade from 0-5 on each discussion day based on their participation. If I feel that students are not diligently doing the readings, <em>I reserve the right to implement readings-based quizzes and allocate some of the participation grade towards them.</em></p>
<h4 id="short-papers" class="unnumbered">Short Papers</h4>
<p>There will be two short papers on assigned topics. The first will be early in the semester, covering topics from the first several weeks. The second will cover topics from the remaining weeks. I am looking for 3-5 page papers that explore subjects prompted by questions that I will provide to you in advance. However, I also encourage you to take the less-trodden path and explore something unique and interesting to you.</p>
<h4 id="final-exam" class="unnumbered">Final exam</h4>
<p>The take-home final exam will be a series of essay questions.</p>
