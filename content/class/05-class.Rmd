# Overview

We begin with our approach to trying to "model" development. We begin at the micro-level and begin with the original - Adam Smith. We cover major concepts that are key tohow prosperity grows (division of labor, transition from subsistence to exchange, etc) and how markets work. In exploring markets (much in the way you would in ECON 306), we highlight the role of prices and entrepreneurship in bringing about coordination and progress - in doing so, we apply Hayek's answer to the socialist calculation debate of the previous lesson.

There are no formal "models" here, only major concepts, but they are coming in the next lesson, which takes a more macroeconomic view towards understanding, modeling, and stimulating economic growth. *This* lesson will have no discussion, I will lecture for 2 class periods. Our next lesson, which may take 1-3 class periods, will end in a discussion on all of these concepts and models.

In thinking about how to "model" an economy in a way that policymakers can exploit (e.g. manipulate key choice variables that can be changed) and assess the results, consider again: what exactly are we able to control? What knowledge must policymakers possess? What incentives ensure it gets implemented "the way we want?"

Discussion/participation grades from the combination of your emailed questions and discussion participation (out of 5 points) for last week's discussion will be posted on Blackboard shortly.

## Growth Accounting

Take the production function of the general form: 
$$Y=f(A,L,K)$$
where $Y$ is output, $K$ is total capital stock, $L$ is total labor, and $A$ is TFP. 

Take standard assumptions about $f$: it is increasing in $A$, $L$, & $K$, and is homogenous of degree 1 (constant returns to scale), so we can assume perfect competition, whereby:

$$\begin{align*}
\frac{dY}{dK}=MP_K&=r\\
\frac{dY}{dL}=MP_L&=w\\
\end{align*}$$

Totally differentiate the production function:

$$dY=F_A dA+F_K dK + F_L dL$$

where $F_i$ denotes the partial derivative of $F$ w.r.t. factor $i$, aka the marginal product of $i$. With perfect competition, this becomes:

\begin{align*}
dY&=F_A dA + MP_K dK+ MP_L dL\\
dY&=F_A dA + r dK + w dL\\
\end{align*}

Divide by $Y$ and convert each change into growth rates:

$$\frac{dY}{Y}=\left(\frac{F_A A}{Y}\right)\left(\frac{dA}{A}\right)+\left(\frac{rK}{Y}\right)\left(\frac{dK}{K}\right)+\left(\frac{wL}{L}\right)\left(\frac{dL}{L}\right)$$

Now, denote the growth rate (% change over time) of each factor $i$ as $g_i=\frac{di}{i}$:

$$g_Y=(\frac{F_A A}{Y})*g_A + (\frac{rK}{Y})*g_K+(\frac{wL}{Y})*g_L$$

Then $\frac{rK}{Y}$ is the share of total income that goes to capital, denoted $\alpha$, and $\frac{wL}{Y}$ is the share that goes to labor, denoted as $1-\alpha$. Re-express the equation as:

$$g_Y=\frac{F_A A}{Y}*g_A+ \alpha g_K+(1-\alpha)g_L$$

In principle, $\alpha, g_Y, g_L$ are observable, but the Solow residual term $\frac{F_A A}{Y}$ isn't. We can measure it as the portion of increase in total income not accounted for by (weighted) growth of factor inputs:

$$SolowResidual=g_Y-\alpha g_K-(1-\alpha)g_L$$
