<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>We begin with our approach to trying to “model” development. We begin at the micro-level and begin with the original - Adam Smith. We cover major concepts that are key tohow prosperity grows (division of labor, transition from subsistence to exchange, etc) and how markets work. In exploring markets (much in the way you would in ECON 306), we highlight the role of prices and entrepreneurship in bringing about coordination and progress - in doing so, we apply Hayek’s answer to the socialist calculation debate of the previous lesson.</p>
<p>There are no formal “models” here, only major concepts, but they are coming in the next lesson, which takes a more macroeconomic view towards understanding, modeling, and stimulating economic growth. <em>This</em> lesson will have no discussion, I will lecture for 2 class periods. Our next lesson, which may take 1-3 class periods, will end in a discussion on all of these concepts and models.</p>
<p>In thinking about how to “model” an economy in a way that policymakers can exploit (e.g. manipulate key choice variables that can be changed) and assess the results, consider again: what exactly are we able to control? What knowledge must policymakers possess? What incentives ensure it gets implemented “the way we want?”</p>

<h2 id="readings">Readings</h2>
<p>See this week’s <a href="/reading/04-reading">readings page</a> for <em>recommended</em> readings, as there will be no formal discussion this week. I still encourage you to look at them. Note <em>next week’s required</em> readings will require you to have the textbooks!</p>
<h2 id="discussion-grades">Discussion Grades</h2>
<p>Discussion/participation grades from the combination of your emailed questions and discussion participation (out of 5 points) for last week’s discussion will be posted on Blackboard shortly.</p>

<h3 id="growth-accounting">Growth Accounting</h3>
<p>Take the production function of the general form:
<span class="math display">\[Y=f(A,L,K)\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is output, <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is total capital stock, <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is total labor, and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is TFP.</p>
<p>Take standard assumptions about <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>: it is increasing in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>, &amp; <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, and is homogenous of degree 1 (constant returns to scale), so we can assume perfect competition, whereby:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\frac{dY}{dK}=MP_K&amp;=r\\
\frac{dY}{dL}=MP_L&amp;=w\\
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>Totally differentiate the production function:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[dY=F_A dA+F_K dK + F_L dL\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(F_i\)</span> denotes the partial derivative of <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> w.r.t. factor <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, aka the marginal product of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. With perfect competition, this becomes:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
dY&amp;=F_A dA + MP_K dK+ MP_L dL\\
dY&amp;=F_A dA + r dK + w dL\\
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>Divide by <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and convert each change into growth rates:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{dY}{Y}=\left(\frac{F_A A}{Y}\right)\left(\frac{dA}{A}\right)+\left(\frac{rK}{Y}\right)\left(\frac{dK}{K}\right)+\left(\frac{wL}{L}\right)\left(\frac{dL}{L}\right)\]</span></p>
<p>Now, denote the growth rate (% change over time) of each factor <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(g_i=\frac{di}{i}\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[g_Y=(\frac{F_A A}{Y})*g_A + (\frac{rK}{Y})*g_K+(\frac{wL}{Y})*g_L\]</span></p>
<p>Then <span class="math inline">\(\frac{rK}{Y}\)</span> is the share of total income that goes to capital, denoted <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{wL}{Y}\)</span> is the share that goes to labor, denoted as <span class="math inline">\(1-\alpha\)</span>. Re-express the equation as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[g_Y=\frac{F_A A}{Y}*g_A+ \alpha g_K+(1-\alpha)g_L\]</span></p>
<p>In principle, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha, g_Y, g_L\)</span> are observable, but the Solow residual term <span class="math inline">\(\frac{F_A A}{Y}\)</span> isn’t. We can measure it as the portion of increase in total income not accounted for by (weighted) growth of factor inputs:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[SolowResidual=g_Y-\alpha g_K-(1-\alpha)g_L\]</span></p>
