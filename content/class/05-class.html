<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Here we explore the famous growth models of an economy. This lesson will be the most technical of the semester, but remember there are no homeworks or exams that have you use the models to calculate equilibrium outcomes. It is more important that you understand the basic mechanisms and the major conclusions of hte models. Modern economic development, macroeconomics, and public policy literatures rely heavily on these models!</p>
<p>We begin with a history of economic thought on growth, from the classicals through the famous neoclassical models and their extensions in the 1950s-1980s. Before we reach the major models, we mention, among others, David Ricardo for his insistence on diminishing returns and the steady state, the Harrod-Domar model for the first major milestone in growth modeling, and Nicholas Kaldor for his famous “stylized facts” that growth models must explain.</p>
<p>We look first at the famous Solow model, or “exogenous growth” model of Robert Solow. Physical capital plays a central role in the model, requiring an economy to accumulate an optimal stock of physical capital (relative to labor) in order to achieve a steady-state growth path. The more surprising element is that growth in output empirically is explained almost entirely (about 80%) by achievements in “technology” or “total factor productivity (TFP),” the unmeasurable “Solow residual.” In these models, the growth of TFP is given <em>exogenously.</em></p>
<p>We later turn to the famous Romer model, or “endogenous growth” model of Paul Romer (and coauthors). Here (inside a Solow-type model) TFP is something economies (firms and governments) can <em>explicitly</em> invest in (via R&amp;D, education, etc.) to determine TFP <em>endogenously</em>.</p>
<p>In thinking about how to “model” an economy in a way that policymakers can exploit (e.g. manipulate key choice variables that can be changed) and assess the results, consider again: what exactly are we able to control? What knowledge must policymakers possess? What incentives ensure it gets implemented “the way we want?”</p>

<h3 id="cobb-douglas-functions">Cobb-Douglas Functions</h3>
<p>A Cobb-Douglas function takes the form:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y=Ax_1^\alpha x_2 ^\beta\]</span></p>
<p>It is often used for utility functions <span class="math inline">\((y\)</span> is utility, <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span> are goods) and production functions <span class="math inline">\((y\)</span> is output, <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span> are factors of production, such as <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K).\)</span></p>
<p>It is often converted into logarithmic form by taking the natural logs:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ln \, y = ln \, A + \alpha \, ln \, x_1 + \beta \, ln \, x_2\]</span></p>
<p>This function is (surprisingly) easy to work with for its many useful properties:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Returns to scale
<ul>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(\alpha+\beta &gt; 1\)</span>: increasing returns to scale</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(\alpha+\beta = 1\)</span>: constant returns to scale</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(\alpha+\beta &lt; 1\)</span>: decreasing returns to scale</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Elasticities/Shares
<ul>
<li>In the constant returns to scale case (the exponents sum to 1), often rewritten as <span class="math inline">\(y=Ax_1^{\alpha}x_2^{1-\alpha}\)</span>:
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> represents the (fraction of income spent - in utility case; output elasticity - in production case) of each <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span>
<ul>
<li>e.g. if <span class="math inline">\(u=x^{0.4}y^{0.6}\)</span>, consumer spends 40% of income on <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and 60% on <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span></li>
<li>e.g. if <span class="math inline">\(y=K^{0.4}L^{0.6}\)</span>, a 1% increase in <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> generates a <span class="math inline">\(0.4\)</span>% increase in <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span></li>
<li>Aggregate Production Function case: <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is the “share” of output or income going to each factor</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Desirable shape of function
<ul>
<li>Convex</li>
<li>Positive but diminishing returns to each <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x_i} &gt; 0, \, \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x_i^2} &lt; 0 \right)\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>For production, simply replace <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="growth-accounting">Growth Accounting</h3>
<p>Take the production function of the general form:
<span class="math display">\[Y=f(A,L,K)\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is output, <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is total capital stock, <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is total labor, and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is TFP.</p>
<p>Take standard assumptions about <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>: it is increasing in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>, &amp; <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, and is homogenous of degree 1 (constant returns to scale), so we can assume perfect competition, whereby:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\frac{dY}{dK}=MP_K&amp;=r\\
\frac{dY}{dL}=MP_L&amp;=w\\
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>Totally differentiate the production function:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[dY=F_A dA+F_K dK + F_L dL\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(F_i\)</span> denotes the partial derivative of <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> w.r.t. factor <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, aka the marginal product of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. With perfect competition, this becomes:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
dY&amp;=F_A dA + MP_K dK+ MP_L dL\\
dY&amp;=F_A dA + r dK + w dL\\
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>Divide by <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and convert each change into growth rates:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{dY}{Y}=\left(\frac{F_A A}{Y}\right)\left(\frac{dA}{A}\right)+\left(\frac{rK}{Y}\right)\left(\frac{dK}{K}\right)+\left(\frac{wL}{L}\right)\left(\frac{dL}{L}\right)\]</span></p>
<p>Now, denote the growth rate (% change over time) of each factor <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(g_i=\frac{di}{i}\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[g_Y=(\frac{F_A A}{Y})*g_A + (\frac{rK}{Y})*g_K+(\frac{wL}{Y})*g_L\]</span></p>
<p>Then <span class="math inline">\(\frac{rK}{Y}\)</span> is the share of total income that goes to capital, denoted <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{wL}{Y}\)</span> is the share that goes to labor, denoted as <span class="math inline">\(1-\alpha\)</span>. Re-express the equation as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[g_Y=\frac{F_A A}{Y}*g_A+ \alpha g_K+(1-\alpha)g_L\]</span></p>
<p>In principle, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha, g_Y, g_L\)</span> are observable, but the Solow residual term <span class="math inline">\(\frac{F_A A}{Y}\)</span> isn’t. We can measure it as the portion of increase in total income not accounted for by (weighted) growth of factor inputs:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[SolowResidual=g_Y-\alpha g_K-(1-\alpha)g_L\]</span></p>
