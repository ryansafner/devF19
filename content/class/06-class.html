<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This week we consider a controversial topic, the role of foreign aid in promoting economic development (growth) in developing countries. I don’t want to lecture too much, as our reading can provide much better insight, as Easterly was a central participant in this debate. I will give you an overview of the history of foreign aid and its major stages/programs (structural adjustment lending, etc.), the theoretical arguments for aid’s necessity (Harrod-Domar model, financing gap/poverty trap, etc) and an empirical assessment of its effectiveness (or lack thereof).</p>
<p>We will have our discussion on Monday, October 7.</p>

<h2 id="math-appendices">Math Appendices</h2>
<p>Many papers this week<span><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">None are required reading! But if you want to understand foreign aid, or development economics at all, you <em>need</em> to become familiar with the empirical literature.<br />
<br />
</span></span> are empirical, as the entire debate (and many, many things in development economics) revolves around the empirical effect of foreign aid on growth. Thus, the papers have regression models and a series of regression tables. I cover the very basics at a 10,000 foot level in the slides this week (what a regression model is - essentially fitting a line to data points - and how to interpret the results in a table). If you want to understand it better, see my <a href="https://metricsf19.classes.ryansafner.com/schedule/">econometrics class</a>, particularly class 2.3 for the basics.</p>
