<p>We will not have a discussion on these readings for this lesson. However, they may come up in future discussions and provide a good framework for understanding development going forward.</p>
<p>Amartya Sen’s “capabilities approach” to “development as freedom” is a good way to think about economic development beyond just GDP numbers. The reading summarizes his views that are famously expounded in a larger book (<em>Development as Freedom</em>).</p>
<p>Boettke and Subrick’s paper shows (with some modest econometrics) that capabilities are strongly affected by economic development, so GDP numbers remain a great tool.</p>
<p>I highly recommend you watch all of Hans Rosling’s videos. They are amazing.</p>
