</ul>
<p>James Scott is a political scientist and anthropologist who specializes in agrarian and non-State societies. This is one of several provocative books, but the main contribution of this particular book (and chapter) is to highlight the lack of state capacity and its implications. It will really give you a detailed description of how States require “legibility” to command and control resources, and just how illegible societies really are, particularly before the rise of powerful States. I also strongly recommend Slate Star Codex’s review of the book (see below) to give you the full picture in an accessible manner.</p>
<p>Second, Mancur Olson’s work is a very famous model that describes the different incentives of dominant groups that wield political power (i.e. the State) and how that affects economic development. Think about how Acemoglu and Robinson’s inclusive vs. extractive institutions fit into Olson’s model (which came first).</p>
<p>Overall, we will be considering economic history from the very beginning of human society up through the modern era. This was characterized by Malthusian population pressures, so we will explore this as well.</p>

</ul>
<p>Silly as it is, I recommend watching Bill Wurtz’ amazing “history of the entire world i guess,” to give you some proper context of the broad stretches of history we’ll ultimately be covering.</p>
<p>Additionally, as Malthusian pre-modern economies are primarily subsistence agriculture, we should consider the impact that farming has had on humans. See Jared Diamond’s provocative argument for all the downsides of the Neolithic Revolution (the human transition from nomadic hunter-gatherers to settled agriculture about 12,000 years ago). This also fits into Olson’s argument.</p>
<p>The last two are podcasts on the Simon-Ehrlich wager. The first (<em>Planet Money</em>) is a good description of what happened, the second (<em>Economics Detective Radio</em>) is a great interview with an economist working on what might have happened for the <em>second</em> proposed sequel to the bet (and gets into the differences Ehrlich and Simon had in worldviews).</p>

<h2 id="questions-to-read-for">Questions to Read For:</h2>
<p>What do economists miss when they focus only on “the light side of the force” i.e. voluntary exchange and trade? What can we learn from studying violence and coercion as well?
We pretty much know what policies and institutions generate prosperity (property rights, rule of law, etc). Leaders of developing countries know this as well. Why don’t they implement them? Or, more accurately, what would happen if they implement them?
What is the difference between a roving bandit and a stationary bandit (in Olson’s model)? How does one become the other? Which societies today look like which form?
What is the difference between a natural state (or limited access order) and an open access order (in North, Wallis, and Weingast’s model)? How does one become the other? Which societies today look like which form?
For what rational reasons do groups within countries (or countries themselves) go to war when bargaining is cheaper? How do societies minimize this risk?
What is the difference between the mafia and the State?</p>
