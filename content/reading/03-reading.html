<p>This paper by Mises (1920) launched what is called “the socialist calculation debate” among economists across German-speaking, and later, English-speaking Europe. Throughout the 1920s-1940s, economists debated the <em>technical</em> mechanics of howa central planner might optimally run an economy. Socialist writers, agitators, and political parties emerged especially after 1840s I should make clear, the content of this specific debate was <em>not</em> ideological (though that certainly is in the background), but the very <em>technical</em> and mathematical mechanisms of how to replace the market process with state control to attain optimal outcomes.</p>
<p>We are doing this before we fully cover the market process and the role of market prices (next lesson), but the video linked to above is perhaps the easiest to understand and best distillation of Mises’ argument I have ever seen.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is socialism as a viable political and economic system “disproven?”</li>
<li>If socialism is inefficient, impossible, or has poor incentives, how did socialism and central planning in the USSR last so long? Was it <em>really</em> socialism and central planning?</li>
<li>What do you make of the economists’ claims that we could centrally plan, or simulate, a market economy, for socialist ends?</li>
<li>Mises argues that “<em>Every step that takes us away from private ownership of the means of production and from the use of money also takes us away from rational economics.</em>” While there are no serious attempts at socialist societies anymore, and all societies are some variant of capitalism, democracy, and/or a mixed economy, does Mises’ quote (and broader claim) still have relevance today?</li>
<li>[A majority of young Americans] have positive feelings towards socialism, and negative feelings towards capitalism. Why do people still advocate for socialism today? Is it the same kind socialism as Marx envisioned, or the Soviet experience? What about “capitalism?”</li>
<li>How can we trace the differences and divergences between the Marxian view of the State and the liberal (Smith, Locke, etc) view of the State?</li>
</ul>
