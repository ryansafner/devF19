<h2 id="questions-to-read-for">Questions to Read For:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Why did the Industrial Revolution occur England in the 1800s? Why not elsewhere, or at other times?</p></li>
<li><p>What remnants of feudal ideas, institutions, and customs remain today?</p></li>
<li><p>Was feudalism optimal or efficient for societies at the time, given their constraints?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did feudalism last so long? What prevented an escape to another (better?) system?</p></li>
<li><p>How specifically did feudalism transition into something else – mercantilism, capitalism, socialism, etc. What were the main mechanisms of change?</p></li>
<li><p>How do reforms come about? How are they made incentive-compatible, so that the elite (that would lose power during reform) permit it?
How well do Olson and Weingast’s models fit feudalism, and what will come after (or remain today in some countries)?</p></li>
<li><p>Were monopolies, guilds, created rents and rent-seeking, and other restrictions on trade as bad as we economists would say they are today in markets?</p></li>
</ul>
